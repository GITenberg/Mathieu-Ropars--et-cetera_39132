<h3>I.</h3>


<p>At the extremity of the roadstead of Brest, in the
open space that lies stretched out between the Ile Longue
and Point Kelerne, may be seen two rocks crowned
with massive granite buildings, and standing boldly
up. On the former, the lazaretto of Trébéron has
been established; the latter, which in other days was
used as a burial-ground and thence took its name of
the Ile des Morts, now contains the principal powder-magazine
of the naval arsenal. The two rocks separated
by an arm of the sea, are about six miles distant
from Brest. In appearance these little islands are not
unlike. Beyond the ground occupied by the buildings
upon them, they offer nothing to the eye save a succession
of stony slopes, dotted here and there with
coarse moss and prickly thorn-broom. Vainly there
might you look for any other shelter than that afforded
by the fissures of the rocks, for any other shade
than that of the walls, for any other walk than the
short terrace contrived in front of the buildings. Naked
and sterile, the two isles remind you of a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
immense sentry-boxes in stone, placed there for the
purpose of keeping guard over the sea, which is roaring
beneath them. But if the foot that treads them
remains imprisoned within a narrow circle, the view
from their summit extends over an infinite space.
Here, you have the bay of Lanvoc, bordered by a dull-looking
and stunted vegetation; there, Roscanvel
with its shadows crossed by the graceful spire of its
church; there, Spanish Point bristling with batteries;
and lastly, close upon the horizon lies Brest, with its
dock-yards, its forts, and the hundred masts of its ships,
visible through a veil of mist. Midway opens out the
Goulet, the harbour of this marvellous lake, through
which arrive and depart unceasingly those wandering
sails, that issue forth to flaunt the ensign of France
upon the waters, or to bring it home again from far-away
lands.</p>

<p>A cannon-shot, the echo of which was still booming
along the shores, had just announced one of these arrivals,
and a frigate, with a light breeze, was doubling
the Point under a cloud of canvas. From the esplanade
of Trébéron a man, wrapped in a pilot-cloth cape
and wearing a narrow-brimmed glazed hat, under
which it might be seen that his locks were turning
grey, was looking at the noble vessel as she glided
along in the distance, between the azure of the sea and
of the sky. It was obvious that the keeper of the
lazaretto (for he it was) gave but casual attention to
the sight, with which his long residence at Trébéron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
had familiarized him. His look, for a moment resting
carelessly upon the frigate which had begun to brail
up her upper sails, soon reverted to his more immediate
neighbourhood, and settled itself at the foot of
the pathway, that led from the esplanade to the sea,
upon a group which appeared more decidedly to interest
him. And in truth the object of this rivetted
gaze was of that sort which might have attracted the
least attentive eye. A pupil of Phidias would have
traced in it the germ of one of those antique bas-reliefs,
of which the marble has become more precious
than gold.</p>

<p>Two little girls and a goat were coming up the
winding path together. The elder of the two, who
might be eleven years old, was holding the freakish
animal by one of those long pieces of sea-weed that
resemble strips of Spanish leather. Her black hair
fell down upon a neck embrowned like a raven's wing,
and threw something of a wild hardihood into her expression,
tempered however by the velvety softness of
her eye. The younger, seated on the goat as though
it were her customary place, was of such rosy-white
complexion as you see in the flower of the eglantine.
A tuft of broom, mingling with her golden hair, fell
down upon her shoulder, and gave her an indescribably
coquettish grace. The two sisters compelled the
goat, which submitted most unwillingly, to moderate
its pace; but still, as they proceeded, they were obliged
to double the slender reins by which they kept it
within bounds, and anon to catch hold of the wreath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of sea-flowers twisted about its horns. Then what
joyous shouts and peals of laughter were there without
end, broken in upon by the gentle bleatings of <i>Brunette</i>
as she pawed the ground with her foot, and shook
her saucy little head! Any other hands but those of
Josèphe and Francine would have tried in vain to
make her even so far submissive; but for the latter
the goat had been a foster-mother, a circumstance
evidently not forgotten.</p>

<p>Mathieu Ropars had been watching for some time
this pleasant little contest between the fantastic <i>Brunette</i>
and his daughters, when he felt a hand laid upon
his arm; he turned round and encountered, so to say,
close against his shoulder the bronzed and smiling face
of their mother.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Just look at those children," said he, nodding
his head in the direction of the merry group.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Heavens! Francine will fall," exclaimed the
mother, stepping towards the path. He drew her
back.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Let them be," said he; "don't you know that
there is nothing to fear when Josèphe has her eye
upon them? Besides, <i>Brunette</i> loves them better than
her own kids; nor are they behind-hand in returning
it. Heaven forgive me, if that creature isn't what
they think most of&mdash;after us!"</p>

<p>&mdash;"And after Monsieur Gabriel," chimed in their
mother&mdash;"at least so far as Josèphe is concerned; for
although he scarcely stayed more than a week in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
lazaretto, and that's three years ago, the child never
lets a day pass by without speaking of him."</p>

<p>&mdash;"To tell the truth, the Lieutenant is a sort of
man not easily to be forgotten," replied Ropars, "especially
by the little one yonder, to whom he was so
kind and made so many promises. Why, wasn't he to
bring her all manner of wonderful things from the
East? And by the bye, if nothing has happened to
him, I believe that we shall pretty soon see him again,
as well as the <i>Thetis</i>."</p>

<p>&mdash;"In the meantime I must tell the children of
another visit, which will also be no small treat for
them."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Whose?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Cousin's, and little Michael's."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Dorot's coming?" inquired Mathieu, looking
towards the platform of the Ile des Morts. "How do
you know?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Can't we talk by signal just as well as his Majesty's
ships?" said Geneviève laughing. "Look, he
has hung out of his window three small red handkerchiefs;
that's to tell us that he's coming over. Besides,
I saw Michael going down to the Superintendent's."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Bravo!" cried Ropars, his face lighting up;
"your cousin and the boy must sup with us&mdash;that is
to say, if your pantry is not quite so empty as your
hospital."</p>

<p>Geneviève protested, and then enumerated with an
air of complacency all her culinary resources, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
had fortunately been replenished, two days before, by
the Superintendent, who supplied at the same time
the powder-magazine and the lazaretto. Mathieu promised
to complete the feast by broaching for the artillery-man
an old bottle of Rousillon wine, stowed
away for a long time under the sand of his cellar.</p>

<p>The two little girls at this moment came up on to
the terrace.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Quick, here!" cried Geneviève, "quick; there's
somebody coming."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Monsieur Gabriel?" asked Josèphe, springing
forward with this exclamation.</p>

<p>&mdash;"No, no, goose-cap&mdash;cousin Dorot and little
Michael."</p>

<p>An involuntary gesture of disappointment escaped
from the child; but Francine clapped her hands and
broke out into shouts of joy. The goat, left to herself,
bounded along the precipitous slopes of the rocks,
where she set to work browsing on the tufts of brackish
herbage; the sisters took each other's hand to go
down towards the little landing-place; whilst their
mother went into the house with a view of getting
everything in readiness.</p>

<p>As had been remarked by the last-named, the special
affection of Josèphe for Monsieur Gabriel was already
of several years standing. It dated from a quarantine
performed at Trébéron by the Lieutenant,
who, charmed by her grace, bordering though it was
upon the savage, had exhibited towards her a marked
regard, to which the child had responded with what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
amounted almost to a passion. Having entered the
navy against his inclination, Monsieur Gabriel had
adopted little of it but its uniform. In the midst of
a life of change, hardship, and adventure, he dreamed
unceasingly of the unchangeableness of the domestic
hearth, and of peaceful family enjoyments. He was
one of those lovers of solitude, who are born to live
amongst labourers, and women, and children. Confined
to the lazaretto of Trébéron, he had brought thither
a few favourite books, and his violin, on which he
played for hours at a time, with no other end than the
listening to its melodious vibrations. When he went
out, Josèphe ran to meet him, acted as his guide along
the rocks, and escorted him to their most secluded
recesses, in which, day by day, he discovered some unknown
plant, or moss that was new to him. In the
evening, be paid a visit to the old quarter-master
whose quiet enjoyment of life had attracted his notice.
Geneviève talked to him of her children; Josèphe
begged of him a story or a song; and when it was
time for him to retire for the night, he went back to
his cell, light hearted and with tranquil mind. A
fortnight thus slipped away as if it had been an hour; so
that when his quarantine was at length performed, and
it was necessary for him to leave Trébéron, his deliverance
did but awaken in him a feeling of regret. He
came back several times to pass whole days upon the
lonely islet; and when finally he was embarking for a
distant voyage of discovery, he promised the solitary
family that he would occasionally write to them. Ro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>pars
had in fact received some letters from him; and,
as we have seen, was expecting his speedy return.
For the moment, the visit announced by Geneviève exclusively
occupied the keeper of the lazaretto. He
remained alone upon the esplanade, whence he continued
to look towards the Ile des Morts. The distance
rendered visible everything done there; it was easy
to recognize persons and to distinguish their movements.
He could therefore see Dorot take his way
towards the skiff, set up the mast, and hoist the sail;
and the little Michael catching hold, with some difficulty,
of the tiller.</p>

<p>Previously to the two families becoming allied by
marriage, the keepers of the powder-magazine and of
the lazaretto had known each other in the navy, wherein
one was a quarter-master and the other a sergeant
of artillery. Appointed to Trébéron, Mathieu Ropars
had rejoiced at the idea of meeting his old ship-mate
Dorot, already several years established at the Ile des
Morts, with his wife, his son, and a female orphan relative.
The lazaretto being almost always deserted, he
was left with ample leisure for frequent visits to the
powder-magazine, and for becoming well known there
and thoroughly appreciated. Geneviève, Dorot's cousin,
was particularly taken with such a character, so
straight-forward and yet so gentle. She had been
tried, until she was sixteen, by all the pains and penalties
of misery. Taken then, from charitable motives,
into the house of her cousin whose wife occasionally
made her pay dearly enough for his hospitality, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
poor orphan had accustomed herself to expecting nothing
at any one's hands, and to receiving as a favour
whatever was accorded her. Thus the frank cordiality
of Mathieu was more touching in her eyes than it
would have been in those of another. She welcomed
it with a gratitude half filial, to which insensibly became
added that shade of a more tender feeling, always
blended into the attachments of a woman whose heart
is disengaged. An intimacy between herself and Ropars
went on, strengthening from day to day, whilst
neither of them took account of their predilections.
As he marked the young girl in the bloom of her expanding
beauty, Mathieu, who already felt the weight
of years upon him, would never have dreamed of asking
her to share his existence; whilst Geneviève, happy
in seeing him daily and in the consciousness of his immediate
neighbourhood, thought not of desiring anything
further. It needed the offer of a situation for her at
Brest, and the consequent prospect of a separation, to
enlighten them as to their mutual dependence on each
other. Perceiving that Geneviève shed tears, Ropars,
who could not shut his eyes to his own distress of mind,
took courage and brought matters to a point. He told
her that she might dispense with this separation, if the
isle of Trébéron were no more irksome to her than the Ile
des Morts, and if his society were as agreeable to her
as that of her cousin. The poor girl, weeping, blushing
and overjoyed, could only reply by letting herself
fall into his arms. The old quarter-master forthwith
opened his mind to Dorot. The marriage took place;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and he carried off Geneviève to his islet, of which
henceforth he mistrusted not the solitude.</p>

<p>The difference in their respective ages did not seem
to mar the happiness of the keeper and the orphan girl.
Both were possessed of that which renders marriage a
blessing&mdash;the simple mind and the heart of kindly
impulse. Children came, to draw still closer these
ties, and to enliven their hearth. The younger was
just born, when Dorot lost his wife, and was left alone
with his son Michael, thirteen years of age. This
premature widowerhood had revived the friendship of
the two old shipmates. Their intercourse became more
frequent. The skiff that served both establishments
was stationed at the little haven of the Ile des Morts,
and was thus at the disposition of the artillery-man,
who missed no opportunity of coming to pass a few
hours with his neighbours. But notwithstanding their
proximity, and the ease with which the passage was
made, these visits could not be of daily occurrence.
Dorot was obliged to be constantly on the watch; his
official orders were equally sudden and unforeseen;
nor could he expose himself to the risk of too frequent
absence. His appearance therefore at the lazaretto
had not ceased to be a happy exception to the rule.
Father, mother, and children alike found in it a festal
occasion; and it was never without great rejoicing that
the signal was observed announcing the agreeable visit,
and the boat seen putting out from the little landing-place
and stretching over towards Trébéron.</p>

<p>This time, so soon as Ropars saw her on the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
he went down to meet her. Scarcely had she touched
the ground, when Michael jumped ashore, threw his
arms about the keeper, then about the two little girls,
and then ran off with the latter towards the house.
Dorot stepping out in turn, shook hands heartily with
Mathieu; and the pair, chatting, slowly began the ascent.
Having reached the summit of the cliff, they
faced about by force of habit, to take a look out to
sea. The artillery-man remarked that the frigate
had just clewed up her lower sails.</p>

<p>&mdash;"God help us! she's going to anchor," said he;
"did you ever see, Mathieu, a homeward-bound ship
let go so far from land?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"That depends," replied the old quarter-master;
"we hold off when we mistrust a fort, or are afraid of
reefs."</p>

<p>&mdash;"But there's nothing of that sort here," remarked
Dorot; "the frigate has no need to fear the guns of
the Castle which are her very good friends, or the
roadstead which is as safe an anchorage as if she were
fast in the dry-dock. There must be something extraordinary."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Perhaps the ship has to perform quarantine,"
suggested Ropars; "the <i>Thetis</i> is expected."</p>

<p>&mdash;"That's it; you've named her," cried the artillery-man,
winking his eye and shading his forehead
with one hand so as to look more fixedly at the distant
vessel; "it is the <i>Thetis</i>, or I'm a heathen. I had
her down yonder for a week, when she took her pow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>der
on board; I know her by the set of her masts and
by her bearing on the water."</p>

<p>&mdash;"The <i>Thetis</i>!" echoed Mathieu; "then we
shall soon see Monsieur Gabriel. What delight for
Josèphe! Quick; let's tell her."</p>

<p>He was hurrying off, but Dorot kept him back.
"No hurry," said he; "never reckon too surely on
what a ship brings home. Pick people out, and they're
just those that are missing when the roll's called.
Better wait till the Lieutenant brings his own news."</p>

<p>&mdash;"You're right," replied the quarter-master;
"the more so since the frigate comes, if I don't mistake,
from the Havannah."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Who knows whether she won't bring you some
lodgers for your lazaretto?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"So be it; they'll be welcome. With Geneviève
and the children, one can't be dull; but once in a
while there's no harm in a little company. You fellows
at the Ile des Morts, you have the artillery despatch-carrier,
who keeps you up to all that goes on,
to say nothing of inspections and your convoys of powder;
whilst here&mdash;never a thing! Not one visitor in
a twelvemonth! At least, if you have to put people
sometimes into quarantine, you hear what's done on
land there, and that leaves you some thing to talk about
for months."</p>

<p>The artillery-man shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"That's
all very well, when they don't bring disease with them;
but the old coasters still talk of a quarantine in which
the lazaretto ran short of both earth and rock for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
burying the dead, and when the bodies were of necessity
thrown into the sea with a shot attached to their
necks, as in vessels out on a voyage."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Now may Christ spare us such a trial!" exclaimed
Ropars, respectfully touching his hat, as he
was used to do whenever he pronounced the Saviour's
name. "But you're speaking of a long time ago,
Dorot; please Heaven, we won't see such again.
There are no heathen here now; and I believe that
God's good will will take care of us."</p>

<p>Dorot nodded his acquiescence. In fact this confidence,
springing from a simple faith, had up to that
time been justified by experience. During the thirteen
years that the keeper had spent at Trébéron, he had
only received healthy persons into quarantine, who
were complying with a formal regulation, and were
obliged to make proof of their good health by undergoing
this preventive sequestration. There were indeed
rare exceptions. Like all lazarettos, that of
Trébéron remained generally unoccupied; and the
keeper kept watch there alone, like an ever-living sentinel
posted in advance of the continent, for the purpose
of warding off contagion.</p>

<p>As they chatted, Dorot and he had reached the
house. Geneviève was waiting for them at the doorway,
surrounded by the three children who laid hold
of and talked to her all at once. After an exchange
of their accustomed friendly greetings, she went in,
with the two keepers, whilst Michael drew off Francine
and Josèphe towards <i>Brunette</i>, who was waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
for them on a pinnacle of rock, eyeing them and bleating
at them. The youngster, accustomed to chase his
father's sheep upon the declivities of the Ile des Morts,
endeavored to get at her; but the capricious creature
sprung from point to point along the precipices, letting
herself at every moment almost be caught, and
at every moment bounding away from the hand that
just could touch her.</p>

<p>Whilst the children kept up this chase, with a thousand
calls to one another and a thousand peals of
laughter, Ropars and Dorot entered the eating-room
in which Geneviève was already laying the cloth. It
was a room of middling size, furnished by the keeper
himself at the period of his marriage, and ornamented
with a few marine engravings. Amongst these was
particularly distinguished a portrait of Jean Bart,
that nautical Hercules on whom, as all the world
knows, his traditional celebrity has fastened all manner
of superhuman exploits and impossible adventures.</p>

<p>Having made his guest sit down, Mathieu went off
to disinter his bottle of Rousillon wine; and brought
it back all whitened with the sand, and capped with a
green-waxed cork that bespoke its noble birth-place.
Dorot good-temperedly complained of such extravagance,
and hinted that he could not make his visit a
long one, inasmuch as the officer commanding the post
of the Ile des Morts had charged him to bring the skiff
back before sunset. Geneviève therefore hurried herself
to serve up the dinner, and called the children to
take their places at table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>With persons whose entire life was contracted within
the narrow limits of two small islands, the conversation
could not be much varied. Mathieu talked of
his still-lines set between the headlands of Trébéron,
and Dorot of his small cherry-tree. The latter might
be regarded as the one stumbling block of pride, over
which the habitual modesty of the worthy sergeant
was sure to trip. No other keeper before his time had
succeeded in securing what he planted, from the
sea wind; this was the only tree that had ever been
seen in the two islands; and Lucullus might well have
been less proud of the first cherry-tree that he brought
from Persia, for the purpose of gracing his triumph.
Humble as regards everything else, Dorot drew himself
up proudly when there was any question of his
poor wild-stock; he only let it be seen by his friends
and his superiors, and then at their urgent solicitation.
Objects resemble human kind, and very often
assume the importance that is given them, in place of
that to which they are entitled. Thus overcharged
and carefully tended, the fame of the cherry-tree of
the Ile des Morts went abroad from Plougastel to
Camaret; it was everywhere talked of as a prodigy.
The pride of Dorot had increased in a corresponding
degree, and was just now swollen to the highest pitch
by an event no less extraordinary than unforseen. He
brought the news of it to Trébéron, but would not
make it known too abruptly. All supposable things
were first to be run over, as in the famous letter of
Madame de Sevigné on the marriage of Mademoi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>selle.
Finally, when every one had given it up, he
determined to enlighten them, and announced ...
that the cherry-tree was in blossom!</p>

<p>Unanimous was the cry of astonishment and delight.
Prisoners in their island, it was several years since
Ropars and Geneviève had seen a tree in blossom; and
the two little girls could not recall to mind that they had
ever seen one. Loudly and both at once, they beset
Michael with questions. Was the cherry-tree flowering
in gold-colour like the thorn-broom, or in the colour
of blood like the sea-furze? How could the blossoms
ever become fruit? Must they wait a long time?
Would the tree bear the red cherries of the coast, or
the black-hearts of the upper country? Dorot cut all
these inquiries short, by declaring that he would come
over next day, for the whole of the family, that they
might see the wondrous tree and dine at the Ile des
Morts. The ecstacies of the sisters may be imagined.
Their mother could not check their laughing and their
clapping of hands. They continued their cry of "to-morrow,
to-morrow!" just as Æneas' look-out men
kept up their cry of "Italy, Italy!" when they saw
through the empurpled vapours that goal of so many
efforts and such longings.</p>

<p>Remarking their impatience, the sergeant proposed
to carry them over, that very evening, with Michael.
There would be still day-light enough on their arrival,
for them to see the cherry-tree covered with its coat
of summer-snow, and their parents could fetch them,
next day. The children backed this offer with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
entreaties; Ropars smiled, without replying; but
Geneviève entered her protest against it. What would
she do, if Francine and Josèphe were away? Many
a time ere this, on waking in the middle of the night,
she had fretted herself at not hearing their gentle
breathings; she had jumped up in agony, and had
crept on tip-toe to their bed, to touch them and to
listen to them; how would it be then, if they were
not there; how could she herself sleep quietly without
fancying some danger? She would dream that
the powder-magazine was on fire, or that the Ile des
Morts was going down like a vessel foundering&mdash;and
all this was said betwixt a laugh and a tear. The
little maidens, bent at first on setting off, were soon
hanging on their mother's shoulders, touched by her
contagious tenderness, and declaring that they preferred
to remain. The artillery-man insisted no longer.
He took with Mathieu the path that led down to the
sandy shore, and was followed by Geneviève and the
children, all silent for the moment.</p>

<p>The sun declining to the horizon lit up the promontory
of Kelerne, and painted in the passage of Goulet
a stream of purple and gold. A breeze began to play
over the bay, and chequered it with undulating ripples.
The perfume exhaled from the saps was wafted
in puffs of wind from the main land, as were the tinklings
of the Angelus, and the lowing of the cattle
driven home. A consciousness of strength in repose
was perceivable, together with an indescribable air of
serenity, that stole from surrounding objects upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
senses, and found its way to the very depths of the
soul. The sky, the earth, and the water seemed by
mutual consent to have subdued their voices, in order
to mingle them in one harmonious murmur. Without
analyzing the soft but not enervating influence that
surrounded them, the two keepers with their families
were alive to its effects. Silently they went down
the foot-path, pausing upon their steps, as though to
lengthen out the sense of enjoyment, or to taste of it
drop by drop. Having, however, reached the boat, it
became necessary to part. Josèphe made the sergeant
promise to come for them early in the morning. The
sail at last was hoisted; and the skiff, launched out
upon the yielding waves, sped her way towards the
powder-magazine.</p>

<p>At the moment when she reached the middle of the
channel that separates the two islands, a ship's long-boat,
unobserved hitherto in the excitement of leave-taking,
appeared to leeward of Trébéron. Her peculiar
build, her black color traversed only by a single
white ribbon at the water-line, and the perfect condition
of her spars and sails, would have sufficed to
show what she was, even if the costume of the double
row of sailors ranged along the thwarts had not betrayed
the man-of-war's men. On crossing the skiff
steered by the sergeant, she was sheered suddenly
off; and by the last glimpse of day-light might be discerned
the yellow flag of the Health Office.</p>

<p>At this sight, Geneviève and the children uttered
an involuntary cry. All three at once comprehended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that these were occupants coming to the lazaretto;
that they would put the island into quarantine, and
prevent all external intercourse. The next day's visit
must be indefinitely postponed, and the cherry-tree
would have finished blossoming before they could have
regained their liberty. This dashing down of a newly-raised
anticipation had in it something so abrupt and
so unexpected, that Francine and Josèphe could by no
means resign themselves to it. Desolate was the look
that they exchanged, and silently did they begin to
weep, as their mother took one of them in either hand,
and sorrowfully remounted the path. Geneviève herself
felt her heart oppressed; on reaching the platform,
she could not but pause for a moment. The skiff with
rose-coloured sail, that bore away the promise of another
meeting and of a festival, had disappeared; the
black long-boat was there at her feet&mdash;and with it had
come to shore, seclusion, melancholy, and disease.
Geneviève kissed her children; but scarcely could
she keep back a tear that had gathered beneath her eyelids,
as without the inclination to prolong her look she
hastily entered the house.</p>

<p>Mathieu in the meantime had gone to receive the
persons placed in quarantine, and to open the lazaretto
for them. On returning, he looked somewhat pale,
and his face wore an expression with which Geneviève
was struck; but at the first question she asked him,
he abruptly interrupted her, to inquire where Francine
and Josèphe were.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Don't you see them?" she replied, pointing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the two little girls sitting down in a dark corner, still
sobbing, and with eyes still moist; "did you think
that they had gone with their cousin?"</p>

<p>"Would to God, they had!" murmured Mathieu
in an agonized voice, but not overheard by the children.</p>

<p>Geneviève looked at him, stupefied. "Why so?"
she asked; "what has happened? Tell me, Mathieu,
in the name of the Holy Trinity! what is the matter?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Well, then," answered the keeper, "there is
... there is ... death upon the island."</p>

<p>&mdash;"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"I mean, my poor wife, just what I have seen!
The <i>Thetis's</i> long-boat has landed her hospital-mates
and doctors, with eight sick men; not one of whom
will ever touch the main-land again."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Holy Virgin! what is it?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"The yellow fever!"</p>


<h3>II.</h3>


<p>For him who dwells in-land, the yellow fever is but
a disease similar to a thousand others, of which he
knows nothing save the name. Family tradition and
personal experience can attach to it, for him, neither
terror or regret. But amongst our maritime population,
the word sounds like a knell; not only bringing
to mind a risk to be encountered, but reviving affliction,
of recent or of ancient date. There, where every
family has one at least of its loved members absent
in foreign countries, the terrible scourge is all too well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
identified with the number of widows and orphans that
it has made. It ranks with the storm and the reef of
rocks, as a deadly foe. Its name, let fall, produces the
same effect as the wind that whistles, or the surf that
roars. Looks are interchanged on hearing it; and
thought recurs to the absent, if not to the dead.</p>

<p>Ropars, on this occasion, dwelt mainly on those
about him; and in truth, no one could have better
right than he to be ill at ease. Thrown in former days
upon a station where the yellow fever was epidemic,
he had seen the seamen of the fleet decimated around
him, and had himself barely escaped, as if by miracle.
The remembrance of that butchery, as he termed it,
was too vivid, and he had too often described it to Geneviève,
for their firmness not now to be shaken.
They troubled not themselves on their own account,
but on account of those whose existence was so dear to
them. Mathieu's first thought was of his wife and of his
children; the first impulse of Geneviève was to fold them
in her arms, and to declare that they must all go away.
Some trouble had the old sailor in making her comprehend
that, even if retreating were not dishonorable
for him, it had become impossible. The long-boat
had made sail for the frigate, and the yellow flag was
hoisted at the lazaretto. Quarantine had begun for
all who happened to be at Trébéron. Not a soul
could henceforth pass beyond its limits: and Ropars
pointed out to Geneviève the gun-boat sent by the
health officer, which had been brought to bear at half
cable's-length distance from the island, and cut off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
from it all intercourse by boats. They were in fact
definitively penned in with the epidemic, and condemned
to run its risk to the end.</p>

<p>But the agitation of Mathieu, in which surprise had
worked its part, did not last long. The quarter-master
soon regained his original strength of mind, which
had been slightly unhinged in the tendernesses of his
domestic life; and, regardless of his own previous
words, he set himself seriously to soothing the terror of
Geneviève by underrating the danger that they incurred.
After all, they were not here in a state of things
that favoured the disease; they had not to contend
against the enervating sun of the Havannah or Brazil;
this was not one of those awful contagions that spread
from house to house like a fire, leaving behind it the
dead alone&mdash;it was a disorder partly spent, and from
which, with certain precautions, escape was easy.
The chief and the most indispensable of these precautions
was to avoid going near the apartments occupied
by those who had been brought into quarantine,
and never to stay to leeward of the lazaretto. Josèphe
and Francine were at once informed of this. Geneviève
explained to them every thing that they were
to do, with a minuteness of detail, that savoured alternately
of threatening and of endearment. At first,
as the punishment for any failure of obedience, she
pointed out to them the disease, or even death itself;
then seeing them turn pale with fear, she drew them
within her caressing arms and re-assured them by
her kisses. Mathieu added to her exhortations some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>thing
more definite and more secure. Next morning,
he marked out a space enclosed with stakes joined together
by a cord, as the children's permitted bounds.
By way of increased precaution, the goat herself was
brought within this enclosure, picketted to a stake, and
fed upon winter fodder. The keeper, on his part, held
aloof from habitual intercourse with the infirmary-men
and the doctors of the lazaretto. He would even have
been ignorant of the fate of those who were in quarantine
if, every evening, the descent of a few men towards
the sandy shore of the little isle, and the tinkling
of a bell that warned him to stand out of their
way, had not made it obvious that their errand was to
dig a grave. The vacancies, besides, were rapidly
filled by fresh invalids brought on shore by the frigate's
long-boat, for the epidemic did not seem as yet
to decrease or to relax its severity. No convalescent
inmate had yet appeared upon the terrace of the lazaretto.
The skiff belonging to the gun-boat, that enforced
the sanitary regulations, came near the landing place
every morning; but no one landed. Provisions and
medicines were put ashore by means of a travelling
pass-rope, set up in the creek; the Surgeon's report
was received at the end of a boat-hook; and then the
skiff sailed away in an apparent hurry, that bespoke
the fear of contagion.</p>

<p>However, after the first few days were past, Ropars
and Geneviève felt somewhat re-assured. The blows
that death dealt around them were mute and hidden;
the edge of inquietude became insensibly blunted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Seeing that it was possible to live in contact with the
formidable malady, they half forgot, both of them,
that is was also possible to die. It was with them as
with the inhabitants of a besieged city, who no longer
tremble at the roar of cannon. In vain did the bell
tinkle every evening, and the long-boat bring ashore
every morning a fresh batch of the death-stricken; the
continuance of the danger made it seem to be a matter
of course, and this feeling soon merged into a sense
of security. Once in a while even, Geneviève forgot
every thing and recommenced her singing; but abruptly
it was suspended at sight of the yellow flag, or as a
sudden recollection crossed her mind. Then the song
was stifled into a sigh.</p>

<p>Ropars had made inquiries for Monsieur Gabriel,
on the first arrival of the sick. The epidemic had
not then attacked him; but his own breaking off from
all intercourse with the hospital-mates, and with the
crew, had prevented his seeking further information.
Several boat-loads had been brought ashore, without
any opportunity for his hearing of the Lieutenant,
when he received a note, cut through with scissors and
steeped in vinegar. It contained only these few
words, written in pencil:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I am come here.... If I live, we shall meet....
If I die ... present this letter to the captain of the
<i>Thetis</i> ... and claim for Josèphe ... my large mahogany
chest.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Gabriel</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The writing, scarcely legible, betrayed a hand that
shook with fever. Mathieu, grievously taken by surprise,
forgot this time all his precautions, and ran to
the lazaretto. But the Surgeon would not let him
see the Lieutenant, whose condition seemed to give
him grave concern. In the evening it was still worse,
and left little room for hope; on the following day
there was none at all.</p>

<p>Josèphe, from whom they had concealed the name
of the frigate that was ravaged by the epidemic, had
no suspicion of the danger of her friend; still, her sister
and herself had none the less lost all their gaiety.
Prisoners within the narrow bounds marked out by
their father, they were both moodily seated near the
stake to which the goat was picketted; and she, lying
down at their feet, seemed to disdain the fodder that
was scattered before her. Josèphe, holding Francine
propped against her, proposed to her, one after
another, all the little games to which they were accustomed;
but the child shook her head, her eyes
fixed upon the sea.</p>

<p>&mdash;"What will you do, then, Zine?" asked she, saddened
by her sister's sadness.</p>

<p>There was no reply. The elder had one hand upon
the younger's head, and played for an instant with
the ringlets of her golden hair.</p>

<p>&mdash;"You're longing to go across there to see Michael?
isn't that it?" she resumed, bending down over
the little one; "but it's too late; the cherry-tree has
shed its blossoms."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;"Then you believe that the cherries are already
ripe?" interrupted Francine, turning up to Josèphe
her face that listlessness had robbed of a portion of
its roses, but with her large eyes full of curiosity.</p>

<p>&mdash;"I don't know," said the elder "mother will
tell us. But let's think about something else; you
know that we cannot go to the powder-magazine."</p>

<p>&mdash;"No, nor to the end of the island, nor any where,"
added Francine, letting herself sink down again upon
Josèphe's knees.</p>

<p>The latter, bent at all events on amusing the child,
then called her attention to the goat, that had just got
up. Starting suddenly from her doze, <i>Brunette</i> was
describing round her stake a series of such droll evolutions,
that the child's sadness could not hold out against
them, and she soon broke out into a laugh. Josèphe,
who at first had chimed in with her merriment, was
afraid that the mutinous creature's gambols would end
by her breaking the cord; she put her hand out to prevent
it.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Let her be, let her be!" cried Francine in high
glee; "look how she rears up! see how she dances!
Well done, <i>Brunette</i>; higher, little one, higher!"</p>

<p>The child, kneeling down upon the sand, clapped
her hands, with shouts of delight; and the goat, that
seemed excited by her voice and by the noise, redoubled
its capricious boundings. All at once, the
stake, loosened by such continued tuggings, was drawn
out of the ground: the animal jumped to one side;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and finding itself no longer held back, started off for
the further extremity of the island.</p>

<p>The two sisters gave utterance to a cry, and then,
from an irresistable impulse, sprang away together in
pursuit. The corded limits were passed, and they
were soon led off along the declivities, calling to <i>Brunette</i>,
who according to her old tricks would wait,
bleating, for them, and then caper away at their approach.
In the eagerness of their chase they thus
reached the summit of the island, followed the slopes
that went down to the sea, and finally arrived at the
foot of the ravine that was farthest removed from their
dwelling. It was there only that Josèphe bethought
her of their disobedience. She stopped, out of breath,
and held back her sister with her arms.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Not a step further, Zine!" cried she; "we
ought not to have come so far; mother forbid it."</p>

<p>The little one looked round about her, and remarked
in turn the spot in which they were. It was a large
fissure hollowed out in the stony soil of the island, and,
at the bottom of which broad ferns and flowering
brooms had sprung up in tufts. Right and left,
through the partition-walls of rock, peeped up the
stone-break, and the sea turf with its purple cats-tails,
and the fox glove that thrust its long stalk from the
crevices, loaded with rose-coloured bell flowers.</p>

<p>At such a sight, Francine could not restrain a cry
of admiration. Here was the first verdure, here were
the first flowers she had seen, since strict orders had
confined her to the barren platform occupied by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
keeper's house. Neither could she resist the temptation;
slipping away from the hands of her sister, and
unwilling to hear a word, she disappeared in the thickest
of the flowering tufts.</p>

<p>Having vainly called to her, Josèphe followed to
bring her back; but the child went on from shrub to
shrub, without any inclination to stop. At every fresh
handful of gathered flowers, uselessly did Josèphe cry,
"enough!" "More, more!" was Francine's answer,
as she piled up within her apron, upheld by the two
corners, all on which she could lay her hands. Want
of place alone could make her consent to suspend her
harvesting. Loaded with herbs and wild flowers, falling
in garlands down to her very feet, she at length
was disposed to take hold again of Josèphe's hand,
who set to work to find their way back, and cautiously
removed the prickly-broom from their path.</p>

<p>The children were on the point of reaching a ridge
made up of heath and broom, when the warning bell
was heard above their heads. They stopped, and raised
their eyes. Four of the infirmary-men were coming
down towards the ravine, bearing their funereal burden.
They were following the only foot-path practicable on
the slope, and the little girls could not proceed on their
way, without meeting them. Terrified, they drew back
amongst the bushes that still concealed them, and
paused, leaning one against the other. The bell tinkled
by fits and starts, drawing nearer at every sound. At
length they could distinguish the heavy footstep of the
bearers ringing upon the rock, and could see their dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>ening
outlines marked out in the twilight. They were
advancing precisely to the little oasis wherein the children
had taken refuge. Arrived at the entrance, they
seemed to consult together for an instant; then resumed
their way through the thorny tufts, rounded the
mass of rock behind which the sisters had crouched,
and stopped, with the words, "Here it is."</p>

<p>Francine, in dire alarm, had hidden her head upon
Josèphe's knees; she, less timid, gently put aside the
branches, and could then see a grave already dug in a
gravelly portion of the soil. The infirmary-men had
laid down the corpse upon the ground, wrapped-up in
a coarse linen cloth. Then they took a sack, hidden
under a projecting bit of rock, and emptied its contents
into the grave. The white dust, that rose up
from it as a cloud, was wafted to the children in a
sour odour of lime. This was carefully spread over
the bottom of the hole, so as to form a bed for the dead
body, and was then sprinkled with water drawn from
the sea. These preparatory measures had all been taken
in gloomy silence. Nought was heard but the scraping
of the spade upon the rocky soil, and the monotonous
bubbling of the tiny waves that rippled with the evening
breeze upon the shore. Josèphe, her neck out-stretched,
her large eyes dilated, and with a painful
sense of tightening at her heart-strings, continued on
the watch.</p>

<p>At this moment, two of the bearers took up the body,
and brought it close to the hole dug for its reception.
They were separated from the children only by a tuft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of bushes. As they lightly grazed it with their burden,
a gust of wind unrolled one of the corners of the
covering cloth; a livid head was visible by the last
glimmering of light; and Josèphe uttered a stifled
cry. The fall of the body into the pit prevented her
being heard; but the moment's glance had sufficed&mdash;the
child thought she recognized the face of Monsieur
Gabriel. She threw herself back, in inexpressible
horror. It was the first time that death had come
before her eyes, and it appeared to her in a guise that
filled her with grief and terror. Clinging to Francine,
she began to tremble in every limb. The noise
of the earth and flint-stones, that were shovelled into
the grave, held her as one petrified. It was only
when the four grave-diggers had left the ravine and
disappeared in the pathway, that her agony found vent.
Francine raised her head and asked what had happened;
but receiving no reply, threw herself into Josèphe's
arms, and began in turn to sob.</p>

<p>The distress of her little sister seemed to counteract
that of Josèphe, who forced herself to stifle her
own anguish, and began embracing and consoling
Francine.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Don't cry" stammered she, choking in spite of
herself; "you mustn't be afraid, ... you mustn't
cry...."</p>

<p>&mdash;"What is the matter with you, Josey; what is
it?" inquired the little one again, holding her sister's
head between her own two hands, and kissing her
moistened cheeks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;"It's ... nothing, ... "returned Josèphe, her
accent belying her words, ... "I was taken by surprise...."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Have the men gone?" asked Francine, looking
with frightened glance towards the grave.</p>

<p>&mdash;"You see they have," answered Josèphe shuddering.</p>

<p>&mdash;"What did they come here to do? They were
carrying something. It was a dead body, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Her sister put her hand upon her lips.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Don't talk of that, Zine!" murmured she, her
sobs again overpowering her.</p>

<p>&mdash;"You saw it?" asked the child, frightened, yet
curious.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Yes, O God!" faltered forth her sister in reply;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"... and ... I knew it again ... it was Monsieur</span><br />
Gabriel!"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Your good friend, Josey?" cried Francine;
"are you sure? And he's there ... there, under the
ground? ... Oh! let's go, let's go; I'm afraid ... I'm
afraid!"</p>

<p>And again she threw herself into her sister's arms,
who exerted herself to the utmost to re-assure her,
and at the same time to control her own tears.</p>

<p>&mdash;"There, stop, Zine!" said she, with broken voice;
"... we must be calm ... we must dry up our eyes ...
or mother will be uneasy." Then raising herself suddenly,
"Hark," she added, "I fancied I heard some
one calling us; quick, quick, let's go up!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>With these words the two little maidens rose from
the ground; quitting the ravine, they hastily regained
the platform, trembling and out of breath when they
reached it.</p>

<p>Geneviève was waiting there for them; but it was
already dark, and this prevented her noticing their
trouble. She took them by the hand, to lead them in,
and made them repeat their joint prayers; both went
to bed, without speaking of the adventure at the ravine.</p>


<h3>III</h3>


<p>Josèphe slept badly; and the next morning, when
she got up, was pale and drooping. Geneviève, who
did not fail to notice it, questioned her with nervous
solicitude; but the child answered that nothing was
the matter. Only, at every inquiry, her eyes filled
with tears, and her voice trembled. Thus languidly
for her did the day wear away. In the evening she
was still more depressed, but still not suffering pain.
She passed a restless night; and on the following
morning Ropars went for the Surgeon of the lazaretto.
He examined the child, and put several questions that
darkened the brow of Mathieu. Geneviève, whose
looks went direct from the Surgeon to her husband,
perceived this; and she felt a blow stricken upon her
heart. At the moment when the two crossed the
thresh-hold, she followed, shut the door abruptly, and
stopped them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;"It is the ... disease, ... is it not?" she asked
in anguish. She had not dared to name the yellow
fever; the Surgeon seemed to hesitate in his reply.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Ah! I'm certain of it," she exclaimed, confirmed
by this very hesitation; "so, our precautions have all
been useless! The blow has come, and all is over!"</p>

<p>She could not avoid sinking down upon the stone
bench, placed beside the door; and she covered her
face with her apron. The Surgeon taxed himself to
console her with vague assurances; but it was evident
that he himself had no longer confidence in his efforts.
Overcome by the implacable power of the contagion,
he persevered in struggling against it, without hope
and from a sense of duty, as soldiers, for the honour of
their flag, defend silently a post that has been abandoned.
So, perceiving that his words, far from soothing
the grief of Geneviève, did but redouble it, he turned
towards the keeper, and, having briefly repeated to
him some directions already given for the child, he went
his way.</p>

<p>Ropars remained some moments on one spot, with
his arms crossed and his head upon his breast; but a
still deeper groan from Geneviève caused him to raise
his eyes. He took her hand.</p>

<p>&mdash;"It isn't time for despair yet," said he, with
gentle firmness; "when God shall have decided against
us, your whole life-time will be left for grief. At
present, let us devote ourselves to our duty, and follow
strictly the injunctions of the doctor."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;"And he has told us nothing at all!" said the
mother, who at heart felt half-incensed against the
Surgeon, for not having more vigorously combatted
her fears; "he has not given us any hope!"</p>

<p>&mdash;"God is the master," replied Mathieu, in all simplicity,
"and so long as he has not declared his pleasure,
we may believe that all will work well; but if
the darling creature must be taken from our hands,
let us at least to the last moment show him, how keen
is our desire to keep her."</p>

<p>Hereupon the feverish voice of the child reached
their ears.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Hark, she's calling me!" cried Geneviève, rising
in urgent haste to go in. Ropars stopped her.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Dry your eyes first," said he, passing his own
hand with fond compassion over the poor mother's
moistened eyelids; "Josèphe mustn't think that you
are anxious. Don't you know that her life may depend
on this?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Yes, yes," she answered, "fear not, Mathieu,
I will not cry any more;" and she forcibly restrained
the tears that were filling her eyes afresh... "Look,
no one would notice it now... And the doctors, besides,
may be mistaken, mayn't they?... And after
all, God will have pity on us."</p>

<p>&mdash;"We must hope so," replied the keeper, much
moved; "but if it is his part to have pity, it is ours
to show resignation. Bear up, then, good heart; go
to the child with a smile; it will do her good; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
first of all ... kiss me ... that we may keep up each
other's resolution."</p>

<p>Josèphe's mother threw her arms around her husband's
neck, and gave way to a new flood of tears.
But she checked them at the sound of the sick one's
voice calling her for the second time, and, by a supreme
effort thrusting down her despair into the very
depths of her heart, she rushed into the house with
calm brow and a smile upon her lips.</p>

<p>Josèphe, nevertheless, grew rapidly worse. In the
evening the fever was doubly hot upon her. One after
another, she spoke of sister Francine, of Michael, of
the cherry-tree in blossom, and of her good friend
Monsieur Gabriel. At one moment she fancied that
she heard the last-named; she called him; she wished
to know if he had brought her the promised presents.
At another time, the scene in the ravine appeared to
be vividly in her recollection; she cried out that Monsieur
Gabriel was dead; and she heard the earth
grating over him in the pit. The Surgeon came to see
her repeatedly, and multiplied his prescriptions, without
power to arrest the onward march of the disease.
That night was an awful one for the hapless mother;
she kept her child clasped in her arms, the little one's
mind wandering more and more. At sunrise the turbulent
delirium was over, to give place to the torpor
that precedes death. At length, towards the middle
of the day, Josèphe opened her eyes, and uttered one
sigh&mdash;it was the last.</p>

<p>The blow had been so decidedly expected, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
despair of Ropars and of Geneviève could scarcely be
violent. The bitterness of their loss had, so to say,
preceded it; both had tasted it, drop by drop, during
the protracted agony. And yet the mother's calmness
had in it a something haggard, that would have startled
a looker-on less troubled than Mathieu himself.
Bent upon rendering the last offices to her daughter,
she was long occupied in combing out her beautiful
black hair; she dressed the body in her best clothes,
and laid it out with the hands crossed over the breast,
as Josèphe had been used to carry them when asleep.
All this was done slowly, tranquilly, with a sort of
complacency even, and often intermingled with kisses.
It was but at intervals that a tear trickled over her
cheeks, that were marbled with glowing spots; it was
but a slight trembling that shook the hand, as it performed
its sorrowful duty. At length, when she who
had brought this child into the world, and who had
nourished it with her milk and with her affection, had
herself sewed it up in its shroud, she went to the window,
broke the stalk of a gilly-flower&mdash;the only one
that the sea-winds had spared&mdash;pulled off its leaves,
and scattered them over the winding sheet.</p>

<p>In the meantime, night had fallen. Deposited at
the head of the darkened alcove, the dead form might
indistinctly be traced through its covering of linen, as
though it were sketched in marble. Higher up hung a
Christ, in ivory, the head bent forward, and the arms
extended. Geneviève knelt down near the bed, and
remained there for a long time, with her head leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
upon her joined hands. Half-aloud she murmured a
prayer; but whilst her lips repeated faithfully every
word, their meaning was not taken in by her mind.
When she had finished it, she raised herself up
mechanically, and looked about her; her brain was a
gloomy chaos. Putting up both hands to her forehead,
she pressed it, with a stifled cry, as though she
sought to stay that whirlwind of confused and lacerating
thoughts. There was, for some few moments, a
struggle between her will and her despair; finally the
former gained the ascendant; she stepped towards the
door and opened it.</p>

<p>Her husband had taken refuge on the platform with
Francine, to remove her from the harrowing sight of
placing the body in its shroud. Geneviève could see
him standing near the parapet; the little girl was at his
feet, with her head resting on his knees. Since the
death of her sister, she had not spoken a word. Fixed
in one place, with eyes dilated and lips compressed, she
seemed to be endeavouring to comprehend what had occurred.
Her two small hands hung down inactive, and
her naked feet appeared to be glued to the ground.
Seeing her thus, under the early rays of the moon that
were playing in her light-coloured tresses, Geneviève
was, as it were, brought back to herself. A flash passed
across the blankness of her expression; her nostrils
dilated; a flood of tears gushed from her eyes. Springing
towards the child, she seized it in her arms with a
sort of doleful passionateness, to which Francine at
once and amply responded, by an outburst of sobs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
caresses. For a long time there was nothing but an
interchange of broken appeals and unfinished phrases.
The little girl would go on asking for her sister, while
the mother, whose despair was revived by such demands,
compelled herself to smother them beneath her
kisses. At last, her strength exhausted, she let her
arms, that upheld Francine, drop down, and felt that
she was gently withdrawn from her. It was Mathieu,
who placed the child upon the ground. He then led
the mother a little further apart, and obliged her to sit
down upon the stone-bench, leaning her back against
the parapet. She tried to raise herself up, as she
stretched out her hands.</p>

<p>&mdash;"My child!" she stammered through her sobbings;
"I want my child!"</p>

<p>&mdash;"In good time thou shalt see her," said Ropars,
who according to the custom of the Bretagne peasantry
only <i>thee'd</i> and <i>thou'd</i> Geneviève, when under the influence
of strong emotion; "but first thou must listen with
all attention, for what I have to tell thee is of the
deepest consequence."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Ah! I would, I would!" was her reply, putting
both hands up to her head; "but don't be hurt, Mathieu,
if it be impossible. I hear yonder, look you,
something that hushes up all the rest; it is her death-rattle,
my good man!... And ... do you know?...
I like the anguish that it causes me, to hear it;
I can fancy that there still is breath in her. Oh! Jesus!
who would have told me, that I should yearn
after the dying breath of my child?" Ropars laid a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
hand upon the head of the miserable woman, whose
sobbings had recommenced.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Be soothed at heart," he said to her with touching
firmness; "the good God wills that we should submit,
and not thus give way. The dead one is now in her
Paradise, where she has no more need of us; but
she leaves behind her a sister, whose life is in our
charge."</p>

<p>&mdash;"How do you mean?" asked Geneviève, raising
towards him her eyes, in which alarm had arrested the
tears.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Don't you understand?" returned the keeper,
lowering his voice; "the breath of the disease is like
the sea-wind; it spares no one; and it may send, at
any instant, the living to rejoin the dead."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Heavenly Saviour! is this a warning?" demanded
Geneviève, clasping her hands. "Must this child
too, be struck down?... Have you remarked any
thing?... Ah! tell the truth, Mathieu, tell it at
once; I would rather be killed at one blow."</p>

<p>&mdash;"So far, the child suffers from nothing but her
distress," rejoined Ropars; "but if she remains in this
deadly air, who can guarantee us that she will escape?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Evil upon us!" cried Geneviève, raising her joined
hands over her head; "why did you remind me of it,
Mathieu? I did not wish to think of it; and now I
shall see her dying, every hour. God forgive you for
thus turning the blade that is within my heart!"</p>

<p>&mdash;"If I touch it, it is but to withdraw it," was the
quarter-master's answer. "It won't do now to shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
one's eyes and let the squall overtake us; we must work
ship with all our might for the little one's safety....
If she remains on the island, you have too many chances
of sewing up her winding-sheet, Geneviève; she
must leave it forthwith."</p>

<p>&mdash;"But how?"</p>

<p>Ropars threw his eyes around him, to satisfy himself
that he was not overheard.</p>

<p>&mdash;"There is a way," he replied cautiously.</p>

<p>&mdash;"The powder-magazine skiff?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"No!"</p>

<p>&mdash;"The gun-boat?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"She's there, you know, to keep guard over the
island."</p>

<p>&mdash;"But who then can help us?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"The tide."</p>

<p>Geneviève looked at her husband, but without understanding
what he meant.</p>

<p>&mdash;"It is now high-water," continued Mathieu; "in
less than an hour the sea will have gone down enough
to leave only four feet of water upon the line of reefs
that runs from Trébéron to the Ile des Morts. With
courage, and by the help of God, the passage may be
tried. I am going to carry the child over to Dorot."</p>

<p>And as the mother could not restrain a cry of terror;&mdash;"Speak
lower, unhappy one!" he added vehemently;
"are you desirous of betraying me? Except the
Superintendent of the powder-magazine and myself, no
one knows the way. We have often passed along it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
when we were fishing together, and always passed it
safely."</p>

<p>&mdash;"But not at night," interrupted Geneviève; "not
burdened with a child."</p>

<p>&mdash;"The child weighs scarcely anything, and the
moon is full," replied Ropars somewhat impatiently.
"Besides, I have been thinking of it all the evening;
and there is no other means. My mind is made up,
and I shall do what must be done, happen what may.
Your remarks may lessen my confidence, but cannot
hold me back. Try rather, then, to brace up my
nerves, as is the duty of a brave wife, and to prepare
the child to go. When the outer point of the high
rock is bare, it will be time for me to make the attempt,
and for you to pray God that he may open us a way of
safety in the sea."</p>

<p>The quarter-master's tone was so determined, that
Geneviève saw at once the uselessness of resistance.
With little will of his own in the ordinary transactions
of life, Mathieu rarely formed a resolution; but, once
decided on, he maintained it immovably. Moreover,
when the first shock was passed, his explanations and
assurances somewhat tranquillized Francine's mother,
and indeed half convinced her. There remained the
child, whose opposition or fright was apprehended by
Ropars. Geneviève went and raised her up from the
ground, and the father and the mother seated her
upon their knees, which they purposely placed close
together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;"You want to see the cherry-tree in blossom,
don't you?" said the former, embracing her.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Not any more, now," was the low-toned reply.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Nay, nay, it is just the time," added the poor
mother with an effort; "over there, you will be more
at liberty ... happier ... you'll have Michael for
a play-fellow."</p>

<p>&mdash;"No," said the child with changing voice, "I
would rather stay with Josèphe."</p>

<p>Geneviève clasped her hands and closed her eyes;
speech failed her. It was Ropars' turn. Drawing
Francine close up to his breast, and whispering in her
ear,</p>

<p>&mdash;"Listen," said he; "we are in trouble. You
would not wish to make it worse, would you? You
love us too well for that."</p>

<p>In place of answer, the child threw both her arms
about her father's neck, and pressed her little rosy
cheek against the wrinkled cheek of the mariner.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Yes, yes, I was certain of it," continued Mathieu;
"and you will do whatever we ask you?"</p>

<p>Francine made an affirmative sign.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Well, then," Ropars went on, "you must go and
pass a few days with Uncle Dorot; and as we have
no boat, I am going to carry you over the passage.
Won't you be quiet in the middle of the sea, when
you have papa's shoulders for a skiff?"</p>

<p>The child shuddered.&mdash;"I would rather stay," said
she, in hurried accents.</p>

<p>&mdash;"But that's impossible," rejoined the father; "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
want to carry you to the powder-magazine. It must
be so, and we are to set out directly. But if you are
not brave, if you think of calling out, the way will be
harder, and perhaps something serious may happen to
me. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Yes ... yes ... I won't go," replied the
little girl, beginning to tremble.</p>

<p>Geneviève drew her once more into her arms.
"Hush, hush!" said she, laying her lips upon Francine's
hair, and rocking her upon her breast, "children
ought to obey.... God has ordained it ... do
what you are bidden ... for your papa, ... for me
... for Josèphe.... If she could speak she would
tell you to be good and obedient.... Would you
make her sorrowful in Heaven?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Oh! no," cried the child, throwing herself again
into Mathieu's arms.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Then you will come?" asked he.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Yes," murmured the little girl.</p>

<p>&mdash;"And you won't be afraid; you won't say a
word?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"No."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Let's be going then!" exclaimed the keeper, who
had got up and was looking over the parapet. "The
high rock is out of water; we mustn't wait any
longer."</p>

<p>He took Francine in his arms and went rapidly
down one of the foot-paths leading to the shore of the
islet. Geneviève followed, in inexpressible anguish.
All three reached a rocky point that stretched far out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
into the waters. It was the extremity of the line of
reefs that connected the powder-magazine with Trébéron.
Ropars placed the child on the ground, in
order to take note of his direction. The passage,
under the rays of the moon, was tinged with pale
green, varied by small lines of white that were made
by the light fringe of foam upon the waves. So gentle
were their undulations, that one might have fancied a
field of green wheat chequered with white camomile
flowers. Beyond, the Ile des Morts in all its breadth
was illumined by the moonlight, with its yellowish
buildings, its long slated roofs, and its lightning-rods,
standing out against the sky. So calm was the night
that the sentry's step was heard, as he paced up and
down before the watch-box of granite, built at the
corner of the esplanade. At the forked head of the
two islands, and partially in shadow, lay the silent
gun-boat, balancing at anchor.</p>

<p>Ropars examined every thing with scrupulous attention.
He pointed out to Geneviève the direction of
the submarine causeway, indicated by a faint shadow
on the surface of the water, as he threw aside his waistcoat
and hat; then taking both of his wife's hands, who
looked at him with haggard eyes,&mdash;"the time is come,
Geneviève," said he; "kiss me, and pray the good God
to be with us."</p>

<p>The poor woman responded at first to his embrace,
without power to utter a word; but when she felt that
he had disengaged himself and was returning towards
the child, a cry escaped her; she was not mistress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
herself. She forgot all that Mathieu had said to her,
all that she herself had promised, and encircled him
with her arms in all the desperation of terror.</p>

<p>&mdash;"You shall not go," she stammered out, "you
shall not go!... It is rushing on to death ... in
the name of your marriage-vow, remain to be my succour,
my companion!... Would you then leave me
here alone with Josèphe?... Look, how broad the
sea is, and how deep! You and Francine, you will
be lost in it!... Ah! if it be God's will, let us all
die here; but at least let us die together! Mathieu, I
will not have you quit me; you shall not carry off my
child; you shall not go!"</p>

<p>Ropars endeavoured to calm her, and struggled to
release himself from her hold; but she clung to him,
and refused to hear a word. And as he recalled to her
that she had, a minute before, induced Francine's
consent,</p>

<p>&mdash;"I was wrong," she wildly interrupted him; "I
will no longer have it so. If you leave me, I will follow;
and you will be responsible before God for what
may happen. Mathieu, do not tempt me! Mathieu,
have pity on me!... What have I done to you, that
you should thus go voluntarily to destruction? Do
you no longer care for life with me?... Ah! if I
have failed in my duty, be not angry with me, dear
soul! If my too great anguish has offended you, forgive
me! I will not cry any more; I will be every thing
that you desire. Hold; look on me rather; forgive
me; but say that you will stay."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>She had sunk down upon her knees, and held Ropars'
hands pressed firmly against her lips. He exerted
himself to raise her up.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Enough, Geneviève," said he, in a tone wherein
commiseration disputed with impatience; "I thought
that you were braver.... This is not what you promised
me. Think, think, unhappy woman, that the
time is passing away!"</p>

<p>Geneviève groaned, and recommenced the same
entreaties. He cast an anxious look towards the sea,
and saw that the farthest jags of the high rock were
dry. Longer delay would increase the danger, and
might render the passage impossible. Mathieu seized
Geneviève sharply by the elbows, and raised her upon
her feet, with her face opposite his own.</p>

<p>&mdash;"On your salvation, listen!" said he, in accent so
decided that she trembled at it; "this is the first time
that I have reminded you that I am your master, and,
if you be not wiser, it will perhaps be the last; but by
the God who saved us, you shall obey, and that without
further discussion! The child's life is to be preserved;
nothing can stay me now. Remain there, I
solemnly command you, and make not one step, nor
utter one single cry, or, so surely as I am my mother's
son, I will never forgive you, even until the day of
Judgment!"</p>

<p>At these words, he seated Geneviève, petrified by
the shock, ran to his little daughter, whom he took
upon his shoulders, and dashed with her into the
waves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>When Geneviève turned round, at the noise made
by his plunge into the water, Ropars was on the causeway
of the submerged reefs, and the waves were rolling
against his breast. She tried to get up; but her
strength failed her, and she could but utter a feeble
cry. Mathieu heard it and looked back. He could
see through the moonlight the indistinct form of Geneviève
who, half-lying down upon the rock, was wringing
her joined hands as though towards him. He
found his heart, which he had steeled by an effort of
will, sinking within him in pity for her. Taking note
of the waters, green and deep, whose abysses were opening
around him, hearing over his head the breathings
of the child who panted with terror, and thinking that
the hapless creature from whom they had just parted
violently might perchance never see them more, there
came across him a feeling of commiseration so tender,
that tears almost filled his eyes; he paused, in spite of
himself, in the midst of the murmuring waves, turned
his head backwards towards the shore, and called to
her in a voice, restrained but full of gentleness&mdash;"Don't
cry Geneviève; and God bless you! all will
go well."</p>

<p>Then, without waiting for an answer, which he feared
might unman him, he went on his way, his eyes fixed
upon the line along the water that marked the direction
of the reef. Soon, however, he ceased to distinguish
that particular appearance of the waves which
rendered it easy to trace this line from the shore. Immersed
in the sea, he no longer saw anything beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
him, but a surface uniform and agitated, without any
distinctive movement or colour. He was therefore
compelled to shape his course direct for the rock on the
Ile des Morts whereon the causeway abutted, and which
with its pointed ridges was visible, far-away in the obscurity.</p>

<p>Armed with a broken boat-hook, Mathieu sounded
at each step that he took; but notwithstanding all his
care, the difficulty of his course increased at every
moment. The unevenness of the rocks exposed him
to incessant stumbling. Lifted off his feet by the
waves, half-stunned by the deep rumbling noise that
was around him, groping along a path irregular and
strange to him and bounded on either side by an abyss,
he advanced with the greatest deliberation, his strong
will controlling his impatience, and his whole soul
rivetted upon his every movement. His fixed gaze
sought to pierce the liquid veil of the waters; his hands
glued to the boat-hook seemed to long to solder it to
the reef; his feet, in an agony of search, seemed to
force themselves to guess at their path, before they
would select it. Thus he reached the middle of the
passage, where he came into the neighbourhood of the
gun-boat. All there was silent; nothing stirred. The
cries of "Watch, Watch!" uttered at intervals by the
look-out at each cat-head, had for some time ceased to
be heard; their two shadows even were not perceptible,
for they had long been immovable at their post.
Certain that their look-out was altogether needless,
the sailors on watch were without doubt asleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Mathieu, who was afraid that they might awake, was
anxious to avoid this danger by hurrying on; but
at the very moment when he came within the shadow
thrown, abaft the gun-boat, over the glittering waters,
his footing of rock failed him by suddenly shelving
downwards. Francine felt him sinking, as a vessel
that founders, and the waves washed up over her hair.
She could not restrain a piercing shriek.</p>

<p>Her father, in extreme alarm, lowered her down against
his breast, and pressed one hand upon her lips. But
it was too late; the cry had undoubtedly been overheard,
for a shadow immediately rose up, forward, and
the noise of footsteps echoed along the deck. Ropars
had but time to throw himself under the taffrail of the
stationary vessel, and to grasp a boom, whereto he
remained suspended.</p>

<p>One of the sailors on watch came aft, and was immediately
joined by his comrade.</p>

<p>&mdash;"The devil take me, if I didn't hear a cry," said
the former.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Pardieu! it half-woke me up," added the second.</p>

<p>&mdash;"But I've looked about, and it's no use; I don't
see any thing."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Nor I."</p>

<p>The couple were leaning over the sea, which kept up
its gentle murmurings, and on which only light undulations
were visible, fringed with half-phosphorescent
foam. The second man of the watch seemed all at once
to be seized with inquietude, that caused his voice to
tremble.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;"I say, Morvan," he cautiously began, "those
Roscanvel and Lanvoc barks haven't passed by, without
leaving some christian soul under water here&mdash;don't
you think so?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Why so?" asked Morvan.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Why so?" returned the sailor, who seemed half-afraid
and half-ashamed; "why, parbleu! ... you
know what they say ... I didn't invent it ... there
are some people who tell you that shipwrecked men,
dying in mortal sin, leave their souls upon the waves
that drowned them: and that every year, on the day
and at the exact time of the accident, they utter a cry
of anguish, just by way of asking prayers for themselves."</p>

<p>&mdash;"And you believe that, you, Lascar?" said Morvan
with a laugh more blustering than assured.</p>

<p>&mdash;"It isn't I," rejoined the sailor, "it's our mess-mates....
But, none the less, the voice wasn't like any
body else's; it was sharp and thin, as one might say
that of a child."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Get out, nonsense!" interrupted the first seaman,
evidently disquieted by his comrade's explanation;
"you see there's nothing more to be heard, and there
is nothing afloat but the moonlight, and the night-chill
that will make us sneeze. It's well that we both kept
our allowance of wine. Come on, let's go and drink
it; that'll put your morality into trim again."</p>

<p>The two sailors went off. After waiting a moment,
Mathieu replaced the child on his shoulders, enjoined
strict silence, at the same time cheering her up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
let go the boom for the purpose of regaining the causeway;
but he had lost the direction, and his feet encountered
only empty space. Forced to swim with his
precious burden, he hoped that a few fathoms' distance
would bring him back to his pathway on the reefs; he
had already gone beyond it. Fresh attempts were not
more successful; and twenty times did he renew his
search, finding only, at each, deep water.</p>

<p>Frightened and panting for breath, he swam about
without aim, endeavouring to touch ground, and no
longer able to distinguish the Ile des Morts from Trébéron.
After having long shifted his course, struggled
against the tide in which every moment he plunged
still deeper, been a thousand times brought back from
despair to hope, and run the full length of his endurance
and his courage, he felt at last that he was overcome.
His respiration grew painful, his eyes were
covered with a film; all things were to him but as a
revolving chaos; his mind wandered. A moment more,
and he and Francine had disappeared beneath the
waters. The gun-boat, which he had wished to avoid,
but which he could no longer perceive, was his sole
means of safety. He summoned all his remaining
strength to utter a cry for help; a surge, more powerful,
stifled it on his lips. Half-fainting and having
nothing left him but that instinctive self-defence which
survives the will, he struggled still an instant, buffeted
from wave to wave; then felt that he was going down.
But all at once, he was arrested; his feet had fallen
on to the reef; they were fastened on it, and steadied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
themselves thereon; his body straightened up; the
water that blinded him seemed to lower itself. He
took breath and looked before him, and could see at
the distance of a hundred steps the cleft rock of the
Ile des Morts. A few minutes sufficed for reaching it.
Touching the shore he fell down upon it, and called
Francine with expiring voice. The child, terrified,
could only reply by throwing herself upon his breast,
where he held her for some time in his embrace. His
first thought had been for her; his second carried him
back to Geneviève who was expecting his return, to
know that they were safe. Still tottering, he raised
himself up, took his little daughter by the hand, and
set himself to climbing the steep slope that led to the
terrace.</p>

<p>It was necessary to make the tour of the powder
magazine, to avoid the sentinel placed at the angle
which commanded the main roadside; and also, on
reaching the magazine keeper's door, to knock gently,
for fear of being heard from without. Dorot fortunately
had the light sleep of old soldiers; he awoke at
the first knocking, and appeared at the window.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Open the door!" said Mathieu to him in a low
voice.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Ropars!" cried the sergeant, thunderstruck.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Lower! and be quick!" returned the seaman
"our lives' safety is at stake."</p>

<p>Dorot went down rapidly, drew back the bolt, and
made them enter the house. Mathieu paused, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
across the thresh-hold, with the child pressed against
his knees.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Heaven protect us! whence come you, Ropars?"
inquired the sergeant.</p>

<p>&mdash;"You see," replied the sailor, "we have come out
of the sea, and we have crossed over it, to come hither."</p>

<p>Dorot drew back, exclaiming, "Can it be? in God's
name, what has happened, that you should thus expose
your life?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"It has happened," rejoined Mathieu, "that Josèphe
died this morning of the contagion! ... that"&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;"What's that you say?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"'Tis just so, Dorot; and as Geneviève and I were
anxious to save the other one, I have brought her to
you."</p>

<p>&mdash;"And Heaven reward you for the thought!" said
the sergeant; "the child is dearly welcome."</p>

<p>He had offered his hand to Mathieu; but the latter
did not take it.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Think well what it is I am asking you," said
he; "perhaps the child may be bringing here disease
and desolation upon you!"</p>

<p>"I hope there will be nothing of the kind," returned
Dorot; "but God's will be done!"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Bear in mind also," continued the quarter-master,
insisting, "that if the thing gets wind, you run a
risk of punishment for having violated the quarantine."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Then the will of man be done!" was the sergeant's
simple observation.</p>

<p>&mdash;"But still think."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;"Of nothing further, Ropars," interrupted the
sergeant; "there! enough said&mdash;too much. No words
about the matter; you have brought me the little one;
I accept her."</p>

<p>He had stooped down to Francine, whom he then
took up in his arms, and with her remounted to the
small chamber formerly occupied by Geneviève. He,
himself, stripped off from the child her dripping clothes,
and put her to sleep in an old cot of Michael's.</p>

<p>The father, who had followed them, remained at the
door with his arms hanging down at his side, the very
picture of gratitude deeply felt, but unable to vent itself
in words. Only, when Dorot turned round towards
him, he seized one of his hands and held it silently
grasped. Dorot, who desired to avoid a scene, began
at once to talk of the means of concealing the little
girl's change of abode. It was sufficient that her absence
from Trébéron would not be remarked; as for
her being at the Ile des Morts, it could not give rise
to any suspicion, since the guard of artillery that did
duty at the magazine, and that might have been surprised
at this increase in the keeper's family, was to
be changed on the following day. Ropars arranged
certain signals for transmitting mutually the news between
the neighbour islands. These were to be renewed
several times a day, and thus relieve them
at least from the anguish of uncertainty. At length,
when all had been agreed upon, Mathieu drew near
the window and looked out. The breeze had freshened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the sky appeared less starry, and a transparent vapour
was beginning to creep over the sea.</p>

<p>&mdash;"It is time to start," said he, returning towards
the sergeant; "may God pay you for what you do,
Dorot! As for Geneviève and myself, we shall remain
your debtors to all eternity."</p>

<p>&mdash;"We'll talk of that, by and by," replied the keeper;
"just now, the main thing, and that which troubles
me, is the passage over."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Don't be uneasy about that," answered Ropars;
"now that the child is in safety, I shall cross the channel
just as easily as one goes to church. The limbs are
firm when the heart doesn't tremble. But I wish I
were already on the other side; I've stayed here too
long for Geneviève, who is looking for me."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Away, then! if it must be," cried the sergeant;
"but for God's sake, Ropars, be careful, and don't
forget that you have two lives to save with your own."</p>

<p>&mdash;"I'll do all that a man can do," returned the quarter-master;
"and believe me, cousin, I've no desire
to die this night!... But too much talk; the time
is slipping away; I mustn't wait for the change of tide."</p>

<p>He went up to Francine's cot, to take leave of her;
but the child, wearied out by so many emotions, had
dropped off to sleep. One of her arms was doubled
beneath her head, and lost in the loosened tresses of
her golden hair; the other, folded on her breast,
pressed to it a little relic formerly given to Geneviève
who, in her superstitious motherly devotedness, had
deprived herself of it that it might be a safe-guard for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
her child. Although her breathing was equal and
easy, still was it broken at intervals by a long drawn
sigh; whilst her cheeks, that in her sleep were beginning
to re-assume their rosy tint, still showed some
traces of tears. Mathieu looked at her for some moments
in touching silence; then bending himself slowly
down, imprinted a light kiss upon Francine's tiny hand,
then one upon her hair, then one upon her cheek.
Without opening her eyes, the child made a gesture
of annoyance; he stood up.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Yes, yes, there, sleep, poor creature of a merciful
God!" he half-muttered; "I will not wake you."</p>

<p>Once more he seemed to enwrap her in a look overflowing
with tenderness; then returned to Dorot, and
took his hand.</p>

<p>&mdash;"I bequeath her to you, cousin," said he, moved
in the extreme; "no one knows what may happen.
Only ... I can trust in your kindly heart, and if ever
the child should become an orphan...."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Now God preserve her from it!" the sergeant
took him up; "but if such misfortune should occur to
her, Mathieu, you know well that she would become
Michael's sister."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Thanks!" abruptly broke in the seaman; "that's
exactly what I was longing to hear.... And now I
set out calmly. I am prepared for every thing."</p>

<p>&mdash;"But you shan't set out thus, shivering and pulled
down," objected the sergeant; "you must take something
to cheer up your spirits."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Nothing," said Ropars, eagerly; "you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
given me all that can give me strength, in giving me
the assurance that the child will not remain unaided.
Providence will do the rest. Your hand! and good-bye
till we meet&mdash;here, or elsewhere!"</p>

<p>They heartily embraced; then Mathieu went down
to the shore, and committed himself again to the waters.
Although the tide had begun to rise, the passage was
effected without overmuch danger. He reached, unharmed,
the high rock of Trébéron which the floodtide
had already encroached upon, and he ran to the
place where he had left Geneviève. She was there no
longer.</p>

<p>Astonished that she should not have awaited his return,
he rapidly mounted the foot-path, reached his
door, and called aloud. There was no reply. The
darkness did not allow him to distinguish any thing.
He groped his way to the hearth, and threw around
him the trembling light of a lamp hurriedly lighted.
Attracted to the alcove, his glance soon made out, beside
the white form of the dead sewed up in its shroud,
the outline of another and a larger form, extended
without moving. Mathieu approached in agony. It
was Geneviève in a swoon.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>


<p>Thanks to the Surgeon's skill, Ropars' wife at length
regained her senses; but it was to fall into convulsive
spasms, followed by the annihilation of all her faculties.
The whole day passed without her shaking off the tor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>por
that belonged at once to sleep and to death. One
might have said that so many shocks had snapped asunder
her existence, and that the quiverings of life, still
flitting across her state of languor, were but the movements
of a machine on the point of stopping. However,
towards evening, the fever declared itself. The
patient passed insensibly from lethargy to delirious
agitation; she did but recognize Mathieu at intervals;
and falling back, with her senses, upon her sorrows,
she soon fell again into wandering.</p>

<p>None of these symptoms seemed to belong to the
malady that ravaged the lazaretto; and the Surgeon,
disconcerted, let Mathieu divine his inability to make
it out. Accustomed to the coarse medicines required
by the robust patients of our ships, he was perforce a
stranger, as are all like him, to the ailments of more
delicate natures. Thus did he stand baffled before this
woman, dying of a disorder such as he vainly sought
to trace in his experiences. He could not conceal his
doubts, and his need of more enlightened advice.
Science, to which these mysterious and redoubtable
symptoms were familiarized, might find there an index,
where he perceived only confusion, and point out a
remedy, which he dared but essay at hap-hazard.</p>

<p>This avowal, wrung from his loyal truth, was for
Mathieu a new source of torture. Shut up within
prescribed limits which forbid strangers to approach
Trébéron, he could not invoke that experience to which
Geneviève might perchance owe her safety. In vain
did he see, at his feet, boats for transporting him across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the sea, and on the horizon a town whence aid might
be brought to him; an obstacle invincible and insurmountable
linked him to his source of trouble.</p>

<p>Two whole days passed away for him, as one long
agony, in alternations of mute dejection and of furious
despair. After sitting for several hours at the bedside
of the dying woman, when he saw the fever that had
been lulled for an instant now returning with increased
force, he ran down to the edge of the reefs, gazed upon
the waters in the midst of which he found himself imprisoned,
upon the armed vessel that guarded the passage,
upon the ravines of the island dotted with graves recently
dug, and pressing his closed fists against his forehead
he cursed the day on which he had accepted this voluntary
imprisonment. Angrily did he call God to account
for the blows with which he was stricken; then, restored
to his religious faith, he joined his hands, and
with tears besought the Almighty to spare Geneviève.</p>

<p>Towards the morning of the third day, he had cause
for believing that his prayers had been heard. The
fever abated, and the patient recovered all her clearness
of mind. But this change did not induce her to
share the delight or the hopes of Mathieu.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Never believe that this is a cure, dear soul,"
said she in tones scarcely audible, and alternating
every phrase with periods of silence; "the disease is
going ... but it carries all with it.... That evening,
when you went across the channel ... when I heard
the child's cry from out of the sea itself ... I thought
it was all over with you both ... and then ... I can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
say what took place ... but it seemed to me ... that
within me ... the main string of life was snapped....
So I feel now, that it's all over."</p>

<p>Ropars combatted these fears, repeating that the
Surgeon was encouraged, and that all would go well.
Geneviève, whose eyes were closed, raised the lids with
difficulty and threw a glance upon him that was full of
melancholy sweetness.</p>

<p>&mdash;"God is the master, Mathieu," said she; "he
knows whether I am happy in living with you....
Only, ... believe me, poor husband, and don't rejoice
too much ... it were wiser to expect the worst."</p>

<p>&mdash;"It were wiser," interrupted the quarter-master,
"to take rest, and have confidence. I, too, trust in
what I feel. This very night, I had a weight of lead
upon my heart; it is light now; I can breathe in one
single breath. In God's name, let your health be restored
to you, and be anxious for a continuance of life,
if it were but for my sake."</p>

<p>Geneviève made an effort to lay her cold and moistened
hand upon that of Ropars.</p>

<p>&mdash;"You are good, Mathieu," said she, letting fall
two little tears, the last that emotion could drain from
eyes already exhausted with weeping. "Ah me! my
chief regret now is at not having always thought of
this ... at not having shown myself sufficiently grateful....
Heavens! how much worthier we should be
of those we love, if we did but remember that some
day we must leave them.... Since my mind has returned,
this idea has haunted me; I now perceive all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
my faults; ... I feel remorse for them.... Oh! tell
me in mercy, Mathieu, do you forgive me now ...
for never having been what I ought to have been?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Talk not so, Geneviève," said the seaman quickly,
and with deep feeling; "you know well that I
could not have asked from God a better wife. Since
you have been mine, I have wanted for nothing; it is
I who should be grateful to you."</p>

<p>&mdash;"No, no," replied the sick woman with increasing
animation; "many a time have I lacked courage and
patience.... Not with you alone ... but with Francine
... with Josèphe! ... poor child of my heart, who
had so few years to live!... And to think, Mathieu,
that I have often made her cry! ... her, who is now
beneath the ground!... Ah! it is the tears of the
dead that weigh heavily here.... And other persons,
whom I may have injured ... and God against whom
I have sinned!... Cannot I then hope for mercy?"</p>

<p>Then, as if this idea had awakened in her a sort of
terror:</p>

<p>&mdash;"Ah! it is impossible!" added she, sitting up;
"Mathieu, Mathieu, I must see a confessor!"</p>

<p>&mdash;"But how to get him here?" said the quarter-master
sorrowfully; "have you forgotten that the island
is in quarantine?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"What! not to be able to save even one's soul?"
returned Geneviève, clasping her hands. "Alas! am
I then doomed to die without reconciliation? My God!
what is to be done? The most miserable sinner is
allowed to confess his sins, and to ask absolution for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
them; my God! must I alone remain without help?"</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly, putting up both hands to her
forehead.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Ah! I remember now," she resumed; "have
you not told me that on board your ships, when at the
moment of death no priest was to be had, any Christian
might take his place? ... that God looked to the
intention?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"I have said so," replied Ropars, "and all the
seamen hereabouts will tell you the same thing, upon
the assurance of their pastors."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Then," replied the dying woman, turning towards
the seaman her eye lustrous with the fever, "I
desire to confess myself to you!"</p>

<p>She raised herself upon her elbow, and crossed herself.
Mathieu seemed overwhelmed, but could make
no objection to her will. As we have remarked, he
belonged to that race almost extinct, even in Brittany,
in whom still existed the earnest and the simple faith
of other days. Often, on occasion of shipwreck, men
such as he might have been seen, after exhausting all
means of saving themselves, to kneel down in the expectation
of death, and confess themselves one to another,
as did the ancient cavaliers on the eve of combat.
Therefore was he more troubled than surprised
at the request of Geneviève; and when he heard her
murmur the prayer that precedes confession, he took
off his hat and made the sign of the cross, ready to
fulfill the holy office that necessity had entrusted to
him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>And something mournful and touching was it. The
early dawn of day light doubtfully illumined the alcove;
the dishevelled head of Geneviève was bent towards
the grizzled head of Mathieu; and one might have heard
the murmur of that supremest confidence carried on
in lowered voice, often interrupted by the failure of
the dying woman's strength, or by the seaman's entreaties
that she would curtail it. But she persisted
in resuming it, with the determination peculiar to those
severe consciences which are never satisfied with their
self-accusations. At length, when she had concluded,
Ropars detached the ivory crucifix from the head of
the bed; he approached it to the lips of Geneviève,
and placing his hand upon her brow with mournful
solemnity,</p>

<p>&mdash;"May God pardon thee as I do to the utmost of my
power," said he; "and if it be not his will that thou
shouldst live for my happiness, may he provide for thee
a place in his Paradise!"</p>

<p>Her face assumed an expression of ineffable serenity.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Thanks," murmured she; "your absolution shall
prevail before the Trinity, Mathieu; now I feel at
peace."</p>

<p>A ray of sunlight creeping in through the window-curtain
reached her bed; she turned round.</p>

<p>&mdash;"It is day," continued she; "I did not hope to
see another.... God has given me a respite!... He
is willing that I should taste of the latest joy that I
looked for upon earth ... nor will you refuse it to
me, Mathieu?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;"Ask it, Geneviève," said the mariner; "what
man can do, I will do."</p>

<p>She took his hand and looked at him.</p>

<p>&mdash;"You have told me, haven't you, that cousin
could see and make out your signals?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Yes, and it is true."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Then by all the affection you bear me, Mathieu,
I beseech you to signalize him at once to bring
Francine out upon his terrace; when she is there, you
will take me in your arms, you will carry me to the
high rock, and if God grant me grace, I shall reach
it with still life enough left to see my child once more,
and to embrace her in spirit."</p>

<p>&mdash;"It shall be done so as you desire, Geneviève,"
said the quarter-master, who, impressed by the presentiments
of the dying one, had abandoned hope, and
had not strength to refuse her anything.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Quickly, then, very quickly!... for I feel that
God is calling me."</p>

<p>Ropars rushed out, as though he feared there would
scarcely be time; but he came in again almost in a
moment, exclaiming that Francine was already on the
terrace of the magazine with Dorot. Stretching out
her hands to him, the dying woman uttered a feeble
cry of joy. He wrapped her up in his winter-cape,
and carried her gently in his arms as far as the parapet
of their platform.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Where is she?" inquired Geneviève, her eyes
blinded by the light of day, and trying in vain to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
steadily; "I can't make out anything, Mathieu! where
is the child: show me the child!"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Look down there at our feet," replied the seaman;
"can you see the high rock?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Yes."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Can you follow the bubbling of the sea along
the reef?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>&mdash;"And away, yonder, over the reefs, can you distinguish
the stone-work of the terrace?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Down there? ... no ... there's only a cloud!
I can see nothing.... Oh! if it be too late!... if she
be there under my very eyes, and I can no longer see
her!... My God, my God, once more, only once, let
me see my child!"</p>

<p>These words, or rather these mother's cries, had been
so full of sadness, that Ropars could not restrain his
tears. He seated his sinking wife upon the parapet,
and himself kneeled down to support her.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Courage, Geneviève!" he stammered out;
"look well to this side ... between the line of the sea
and the sky."</p>

<p>&mdash;"I am looking," said Geneviève, appearing in the
effort to rally all the life left in her ".... Raise my
head, Mathieu ... screen me from the sun...."</p>

<p>She checked herself with a stifled exclamation.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Ah! there she is! there she is!... She sees
me ... she is lifting up her arms.... Francine ...
my daughter ... my child!"</p>

<p>So impulsively did she lean forward, that but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Ropars, she would have thrown herself upon the rocks
that sloped down to the sea. A flitting ray of life had
lighted up her features; she sent kisses on her fingers
to the child, and talked to it as though it could hear
her; she raised her hands to Heaven, with rapid and
broken ejaculations; she smiled and wept at once.
Finally, her strength failed to endure so great emotion,
and her head fell upon the quarter-master's shoulder.
In alarm, he took her again in his arms, to carry
her back into the house; but she made signs to him
that she wished to remain out of-doors. He laid her
down upon the bench, whereon the family had been
used to sit together in the evening, in front of the sea,
which was now lighted up by the rising sun. After a
swoon that lasted some time, she opened her eyes, and
asked for her daughter. Mathieu looked towards the
powder magazine and said that Dorot had taken her
away. She bowed her head with sorrowing resignation.</p>

<p>&mdash;"He has done right," she went on, in feeble accents;
... "besides, I feel ... that my sight grows
thick.... I couldn't see her any more ... and ...
I still have something to say to you.... Come closer,
Mathieu ... closer ... my voice is failing.... Give
me your hand.... I want to be sure that you hear
me."</p>

<p>Ropars knelt upon the sand, with one hand in that
of his dying wife, and the other placed behind her, to
support her.</p>

<p>&mdash;"You are going to stay alone," she continued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
"Elsewhere, you could perhaps endure it; but here,
in the midst of the ocean, it is not the life of a man,
or of a Christian.... You are used to having some one
keep you company ... some one to love you.... When
I am gone ... another one must take my place."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Never!" broke in Ropars.</p>

<p>With her hand she silenced him.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Hush!" said she gently; "you must needs think
this, so long as I am before your eyes ... but when
I am laid in the grave, you will then feel your want....
Believe not that I would reproach you, my poor husband....
I do not wish to carry away your happiness
with me in my winding sheet.... No ... no ... wherever
I may be, I shall need to know that you are well
cared for."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Enough, Geneviève!" murmured the seaman,
choking with emotion.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Let me go on to the end," she resumed; "I
have still one plea to urge.... When you take off the
crape from your arm, Mathieu ... promise me to
think of the dear creature who is our child ... the
child of both ... and who will remain with you, to
remind you of me ... choose a wife who may fill my
place towards her."</p>

<p>&mdash;"What is it that you are asking me, and whom
could I give her for a mother, after yourself?" rejoined
Ropars.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Some one" ... Geneviève went on ... "who would
not grudge me the having been chosen first ... some honest
heart that would take kindly to an orphan ... who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
would talk to her of me ... who would teach her to
love God ... and to obey you!... If you promise
me that this shall be so, Mathieu ... if you promise
it on your honour ... and on your salvation, I shall
fall asleep, at peace, and blessing you."</p>

<p>Ropars made the promise, amidst sighs and groans;
but this was the dying woman's last effort. After
having thanked him by an embrace, she let herself
sink into her husband's arms. It almost seemed as
though the power of her will had slackened the steps
of Death, for the sake of this final compact. Scarcely
was it completed, when her sufferings recommenced.
Carried back to the alcove, she died there towards the
close of the day. Her last words were a prayer, in
which her husband's and her daughter's names were
intermingled.</p>

<p>On the ensuing day, the grave in which Josèphe
already reposed was re-opened to receive Geneviève,
for, during the past month, Death had reaped so
abundantly that the barren island lacked space for his
doleful harvest. Informed of what had happened, by
means of the signals agreed upon, the keeper of the
powder-magazine brought Francine to the edge of his
rock, and the child, on her knees, uttered a prayer for
her mother's spirit, at the moment the funeral ceremony
was ended, across the water.</p>

<p>This death was the last. Like those expiatory victims
who, in sacrificing themselves, were wont to appease
the anger of the Gods, Geneviève seemed, in
going down to the tomb, as though she closed its doors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
behind her. A fortnight later, and the yellow flag slid
down the flag staff that over-topped the lazaretto, and
those who had been quarantined, now cured, went away
in the frigate's long-boat. They only left behind them,
on the dreary island, a man whose hair had become
perfectly white, and a child in mourning clothes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<h3>I</h3>


<p>Do not imagine that this is to be a love-story. Very
few experiences furnish material for such. Rarer still
is the ability to use the material, when it falls in one's
way. At any rate, I make no pretension thereto.</p>

<p>But it sometimes happens during the earlier and more
tumultuous period of a man's life, that casual occurrences
take place, which do not indeed at the time immediately
influence his actions or his fortunes, but which
in later days may be recalled with interest. Of this
sort&mdash;if I mistake not, or if I do not mar them in the
telling&mdash;were my three meetings with Mary Verner.
I only met her thrice.</p>

<p>The first time&mdash;many a year has sped away since;
but it seems, if I shut my mental eye to events and
feelings with which the interval has been crowded, and
my bodily eye to the library table before me, as if the
little scene were being enacted here, now, to-day.</p>

<p>Whence this power of summoning up the ghosts of
long ago? Why should the comparatively recent refuse
to be stamped upon the memory, and the old impressions
refuse to fade? Let philosophers answer; I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
no more inclination to write an essay than to tell a
love-tale. My purpose I have already stated; though
I omitted to mention that I write my own veritable
experience&mdash;with a change of names, a studied obscurity
of dates, and a very slight change otherwise.</p>

<p>The precise year I do not remember, nor, consequently,
my own exact age; but I must have been
about fourteen. George Verner, Mary's brother&mdash;poor
fellow! I saw his death registered, the other day, in
that odious corner of the <i>Times</i>&mdash;was my class-mate
and play-mate at a school some few miles from London.
He was a good-looking and good-tempered fellow, if
not remarkable for his abilities. It chanced that I
was&mdash;in the choice language of the time and place&mdash;"a
dab at Latin verses." I helped George once in a
while with his exercises; and once in a while with the
mince-pies, that his mother's a cook used to send him
on the sly. The first time that I saw her&mdash;Mary Verner
I mean, not the cook&mdash;was on a whole holiday;
George, who lived in the neighbourhood, had invited
me to pass it with him. The old family coach came
for us at ten o'clock, with the fat old horses and the
fat old family coachman, just for all the world as you
may often meet them in the story-books that are called
"exceedingly natural," and as you now-a-days
rarely find them in real life. Pony-phaetons, britzkas,
coupés, "Croydon-baskets," and nondescript vehicles
that, being neither close carriages nor open, are palmed
off as both&mdash;these have superseded the full-bodied of
my early recollections.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>I fancy that I see her now.... You perceive that
though I note the modern change in the carriage department,
I recognize none such in the phraseology of our
tongue. I fancy I see her now. You may, if you please,
alter the wording; but that's the plain English of it.</p>

<p>As we drove up the sweep that led from the lodge
to the front entrance of a very beautiful suburban villa,
I leaned out of the window, with the curiosity natural
to a boy of fourteen, on strange ground.</p>

<p>Mary Verner&mdash;I knew, by the family likeness, that
she was George's elder sister, the moment my eye lighted
on her&mdash;was trimming or watering her geraniums,
in one of the recesses on either side of the porch.</p>

<p>"Here, Mary, here's Cuthbert <i>tertius</i>," said George,
running up the steps, and pushing me before him.</p>

<p>"I know him; how d'ye do? I'm glad to see you,"
was the frank reception, spoken in a clear, round-toned,
springy voice, that seemed to drop without effort out
of a rose-lipped mouth well-filled with well-knit teeth.
And as she spoke smilingly, she opened a pair of large
brown eyes that I have since thought&mdash;for boys don't
know much about the law of colours&mdash;were designed
to harmonize with what we call a clear brunette complexion.
Certainly, if the ballad of "The Nut Brown
Mayde" be a model imitation of the antique, Mary Verner
might have sat for the portrait.</p>

<p>But it was not so much her eyes that took hold of
me, open though they did by degrees, wider and wider,
until I wondered when they would cease opening; nor
her coal-black hair, dressed as you may see it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
likenesses by Sir Thomas Lawrence; nor her rosy
mouth; nor her even teeth; nor her figure full of grace,
<i>svelte</i> as the French call it, for which we have no answering
word. It was not these, or any of them. It
was the carolling of her few words, so free and unconcerned
in tone. If I had not met her subsequently,
I might have forgotten her looks; I doubt whether
her voice could have passed from me.</p>

<p>I need not tax my memory or my invention about
the trifling though happy events of that day. It was
pretty evident who was mistress of the house, though
the fond and proud mother of Mary Verner had the
air of a dignified and well-bred woman. Silent or talking,
it was Mary who dispensed the honours, at least
so far as the stranger was concerned. Probably it was
the same with all comers; but this is only a surmise.</p>

<p>Well; the whole holiday came to an end, and we
were driven back to the old school by the old coachman,
our pockets full of chestnuts, and our boyish
hearts full of a sense of supreme enjoyment, such we
believe as, in later life, women feel after the best ball
of the season, and men after a splendid whitebait dinner
at Blackwall. I recollect telling the fellows in
the dormitory what a jolly time we had been having,
and how capitally George's pony leaped the fence on the
common, round the corner, out of sight of the house. By
the way, it was partly owing to that pony having engrossed
so much of our time, that I had not regularly fallen
in love with Mary Verner. Partly, I say, because I
was further saved from this predicament by a standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
devotion to my pretty cousin Rose, which the temptation
had been strong enough, but not long enough to
disturb. I never went to George's house again; and
ere long the image of his sister was stowed away on
one of the upper shelves of my memory. There it
might have been smothered in dust, or even converted
into it, if chance had not taken it down and given it
an airing.</p>


<h3>II</h3>


<p>Twenty-one&mdash;what a change from fourteen! How
the pulse of life beats and bounds! I was running a
tilt at the pastimes, and doffing aside the cares of early
manhood, when for the second time, I came across Mary
Verner. Plump upon her, I would say, if I thought
you would pardon the coarseness of the expression.
At any rate&mdash;and to be genteel&mdash;it was unexpectedly.
Twenty-one gives very few thoughts to fourteen. It
may be a much longer distance thither, when one starts
at seventy to go back; but it is surprising how much
more quickly you get over the intermediate ground.
Let that be; only I don't believe I had given a thought
to Mary Verner, since the week or two that followed
my first interview with her.</p>

<p>"Do come and dine with us on Monday," said my
friend Mrs. F.; "there will be a very charming girl
here, whom you would like to see."</p>

<p>"Positively?"</p>

<p>"<i>Sans faute!</i>"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then keep a place for me; I'll come."</p>

<p>I went. It was a formal dinner-party. In the
drawing-room, before going to table, Mrs. F. came
across to me.</p>

<p>"Now I'll introduce you to our belle of the evening.
You may escort her down to dinner. There she is,
half-hidden behind that drapery. You can't have noticed
her."</p>

<p>"Miss Verner, let me present Mr. Cuthbert."</p>

<p>I should have recognized Mary Verner, as she looked
up, with those widely-opening brown eyes of hers,
if her name had not been mentioned. As it was, it
was quite natural for me to remark that I believed I
had had the pleasure of seeing Miss Verner before.</p>

<p>And so in a few moments we were gossipping cosily
about "old times," as we, not very old people, called
them.</p>

<p>The beautiful child had expanded into a very lovely
woman, preserving still the same characteristics of
person and expression. The charm of her voice was
the same. You may be sure that when seated by her
side, with the becoming glow of lamp-light overhead
heightening, if possible, those attractions which I
rather hint than attempt to describe&mdash;you may be sure,
I say, that I found her very captivating.</p>

<p>We talked of her brother George; of the pleasant
house wherein I first met her, and which was still her
home; of her amiable and lady-like mother who was
still living; of the old pony now gathered to his sires;
of the old chestnut-trees even&mdash;in short, of all those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
unimportant associations, out of which, under such
circumstances, one endeavours to establish a trivial
and flitting but very pleasant little bond of sympathy.</p>

<p>I declare I was half ready to fall head over ears in
love with her. And she took it all with a simple unaffected
grace, that seemed to be her very nature.</p>

<p>But we did not have all the talk to ourselves. I
had not the presumption to engross her entirely. Nor
would it have been possible. She was&mdash;there is no
need to go over it all again&mdash;she was Mary Verner.</p>

<p>Nearly opposite to us at table sat a Mr. Easton, a
young barrister&mdash;young, that is professionally, for he
was apparently a man of thirty or thereabouts. He
would not have been singled out as a lady-killer, for
he was none of your regular Adonises, such as hang
by dozens, in portraiture, upon the walls of our Royal
Academy Exhibitions, and lounge complacently in our
Fop's Alley at the Opera. When, however, the excitement
of conversation&mdash;in which he took an active
and most intelligent part&mdash;developed the fine play of his
features, you would have pronounced him a man who
added, to a cultivated and superior mind, a look that
bespoke such gift. In fact there was a manly air about
him, that claimed respect, if it did not challenge attention.</p>

<p>About the time when I made this notable discovery,
I recollected that at the moment of my introduction
to Miss Verner, Mr. Easton was gossipping with her
in the secluded corner half-hidden by the drapery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
though he moved away, with perfect good breeding, to
give place to the new-comer.</p>

<p>About this time, too, there began&mdash;at which end of
the table, I forget&mdash;an occasional play of badinage,
whereof Mr. Easton was the subject. For a grave
and earnest man, he seemed to receive it all in exceedingly
good part. To my surprise also&mdash;to say
nothing of annoyance&mdash;my fair neighbour was brought,
after a while, within its scope. Neither did she&mdash;I
was forced to acknowledge within myself&mdash;evince either
<i>mauvaise honte</i> or sensitiveness. The truth was
plain. They were engaged.</p>

<p>As a child's card-built house tumbles down when
the table is shaken, so down went one of the prettiest
little castles-in-the-air, that ever simpleton built out
of cards of his own shaping.</p>

<p>Down it went; though I flatter myself I was too
much a man of the world, to let a glimpse of its dislocated
plan be apparent. Indeed, in a few seconds,
I had rallied myself on my own absurdity; gulped
down my disappointment; and resigned myself again
to the charm that Mary Verner still shed around her,
if its tint was somewhat changed. Besides, I availed
myself of the sudden opportunity thus afforded, for
testing the practical value of one of my favourite theories,
when I was a young fellow and affected to bask
in the sunshine of human nature: to wit, that, apart
from serious love-making, when a woman in either married
or betrothed, she has therefrom an additional
feather in her social cap. So have I found it through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
life&mdash;always provided that the attractive and companionable
qualities were otherwise in abundance. And
this theory has at least given heartiness to my good
wishes for my fairer acquaintances and friends. Is it
not better to come to such a philosophical conclusion,
than to be always envying other people's good fortune?</p>

<p>Shifting, therefore, my ground, I was rapidly possessed
by a strong interest in Miss Verner's future
welfare&mdash;much of which was undoubtedly genuine.</p>

<p>Delicately, and by gently leading her on, I gathered
something of the story of her courtship, though I
must needs confess that I cannot now call to mind a
word of it. It may be of more interest to state that
she was to make Mr. Easton the happiest of men,
within six weeks or so of that time; and that the honey-moon
was to be spent in a ramble on the Continent.
Very emphatically and very sincerely did I wish her
a pleasant time of it.</p>

<p>But the most agreeable evenings will come to a
close. This one&mdash;with its revival of a boy's casual
acquaintance, with its momentary castle-building, and
its subsequent benevolence of feeling&mdash;this one, like
all others, passed away. It did not die out, as the
fag-end of a dinner-party sometimes will; it was cut
short to me by the "good night!" of Mary Verner,
as she took her departure, leaning on Mr. Easton's
arm, in the train of an elderly female relative.</p>

<p>When the drawing-room door closed upon her graceful
figure, I felt for a moment as though the gas had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
been suddenly turned off. I recollect, however, the
hostess's observation, dropped to the accompaniment
of a playfully malicious smile:</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you, you would like my friend Mary
Verner?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply, "and I have passed a most
delightful evening; but I don't think it quite fair,
Mrs. F."&mdash;here there was a terrible smash of the theory&mdash;"to
open the gates of Paradise, and then slam
them in a poor fellow's face?"</p>

<p>I was to have gone, that night, to a ball in Devonshire
Place, expressly to meet&mdash;Never mind; I was
not in the humour for dancing or flirting. I went
straight home, and to bed. I tossed about a good
deal, and finally dreamed about George and the pony,
and that I was climbing the old chestnut-trees. As
for Mary Verner, I couldn't in my sleep conjure up
her image. When I thought I had it&mdash;as is the way
in dreams, you know, if you ever studied them&mdash;I
couldn't get nearer to her than the plaguy old family
coachman. It was only when broad awake, the next
morning, that I found myself strongly impressed by
this, my second meeting. But again&mdash;such is life
and such is youth&mdash;the impression was soon stowed
away on an upper shelf in memory's garret.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>


<h3>III.</h3>


<p>Two years later; two years and two months.</p>

<p>Did you ever notice the marked difference between
youth and old age&mdash;aye, and middle age, too&mdash;in the
matter of reading newspapers? We&mdash;I speak of myself
now as the writer&mdash;who are in the vanguard of
the march through life, must have our <i>Times</i> or our
<i>Chronicle</i>, as regularly as our morning meal. Is it, as
some spitefully assert, that we grow more self-complacent
as we pore over the misfortunes or the errors of
our fellows; or is it, that we seek refuge from the
cares and disappointments of our own lot, in a close
scrutiny of that of all the world beside, with the minutiæ
of which the diligent, prying, gossipping press
so unceasingly plies our curiosity? It is folly, perhaps,
to raise the question, since this is not the place
to discuss it; though it were not far from the truth to
attribute much of the pettiness of our race, in these
days, to this habit of abandoning our thoughts and
impulses to the guidance of journalists who trade in
them.</p>

<p>I only mean to say that being still youthful at
twenty-three, I "cared for none of these things,"
As for heeding who was born, or buried, or married,
beyond the circle of one's own intimate connections&mdash;I
should as soon have set to work to trace the pedigree
of a New Zealander. Probably, I heard in due time
that Mary Verner had become Mrs. Easton. Certainly
I did not learn it from the usual printed record.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
In short, I then very seldom read newspapers at all;
and this I beg you to bear in mind. What a shocking
ignoramus I should be voted, if I were to say so of
this present time.</p>

<p>That, too, was the season of darkness, ere Albert
Smith was the Lecturer <i>par excellence</i>; ere Oxford
and Cambridge men, returning from their "long-vacation"
rambles, disputed in the daily papers their respective
prowess in scaling the precipices of Monte
Rosa, or discovering new pathways up Mont Blanc.
How changed are we to-day! Save for the voluminous
records of the Crimean war, what Mamelons and
Malakoffs would the pedestrians, Smith and Jones,
be now fighting over, in the <i>Times</i>!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though they made less fuss about it,
Englishmen were then, as now, prone to scurrying off
to Switzerland in the Autumn&mdash;some in the true cockney
spirit&mdash;some because they found there the most
sublime of all spectacles, together with the most exhilarating
exercise for the body, and relaxation of
mind in its fullest sense. With myself it amounted
to a passion; "Cuthbert's hobby" it was dubbed by
acquaintances, who could eke out delight from Leamington
and Cheltenham.</p>

<p>Profiting by the leisure afforded me during successive
seasons, I had become tolerably familiar with the
Alps; with what exquisite and inexhaustible enjoyment
I am not going here to trouble you. But August
had come round again. The knapsack was stitched,
where it wanted mending. The Alpenstock was drag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>ged
to light, from the lumber-room. The thick-soled
gaiter-boots were freshly studded with hobnails. The
well-worn Swiss map was conned over once more, and
a new route, leading over yet untrodden passes, was
set down in the Autumnal programme.</p>

<p>Suddenly I changed my mind&mdash;under the influence
of an hour's talk with an enthusiastic mountaineer&mdash;who
had, during the previous season, explored the Pyrenees.
"You may not find," said he, "quite so much
grandeur; but the valleys are decidedly more picturesque,
the foliage more varied, the very tints of the
mountains glowing with warmer colours." Thereupon,
a change of plan and passport. Behold me at Cauterets
in France, instead of at Grindelwald in Switzerland!</p>

<p>Were my object merely to fill a certain number of
pages, I might here descant at length upon the comparative
beauties of the Alps and the Pyrenees&mdash;the latter
having, at present, the advantage of not being done
to death by tourists. But I will abstain. I will speak
only of one day's adventure; the day whereon, for the
third and last time, I found myself associated with
Mary Verner.</p>

<p>Cauterets may be a pleasant place enough to those
who bathe in, or imbibe for medicinal purposes, the
mineral waters that have made its fame. It is finely
placed too, pitched in, as it were, into a nook, with
lofty peaks and fringes of fir forests over-topping its
somewhat formal streets. It does not, however, offer
much attraction to the connoisseur in fine scenery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
One excursion alone is to be made. Its objects are
the Pont d'Espagne and the Lac de Gaube. The former
is a group of pine trunks bridging a cascade. The
latter is a tarn at the foot of the glaciers of the Vignemale,
which, you know, is one of the mountain-monarchs
hereabouts.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further, I may mention that I
am enabled to set down my reminiscences of this particular
time and place, by reference to my rough notes
penned on the spot, journal-wise. The little memorandum
book lies under my hand, with its pages written
in ink of various tints, as hotel, or cabaret, or hut
furnished the material at the moment. I like to preserve
these records. Such <i>souvenirs</i> are the <i>bonnes
fortunes</i> of those whose travels are ended. You see
that I incline to be sentimental as I draw towards the
<i>dénouement</i> of my story.</p>

<p>Heavens and earth, how it rains in the Pyrenees!
What a young deluge swept down the steep stone-guttered
pavements, on the morning of the 29th of August!
Still, I did not choose to devote more than one day to
the neighbourhood of Cauterets; and so, having made,
from my window, a few such profound observations as
the one just set down, I ordered a horse and guide.
The polite waiter was astonished, and protested, to the
extent of two or three "<i>Mais Monsieur!</i>" The guide
thought the storm would expend itself in twenty-four
hours; but on my hinting that the path would not be
difficult to find, without his aid, nor impracticable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
on foot, he subsided, with an air of conviction, into the
accustomed "<i>Bien, Monsieur!</i>"</p>

<p>And so we started. I had borrowed one of the long,
thick, hooded Spanish cloaks, commonly used in that
region which borders on Spain; and a very effectual
protection it was against the steady down-pouring of the
rain. But what is perfect in this world? A German
counterpane, on a summer's night, is not more oppressive
than was this excellent protection from the wet.</p>

<p>Handing, then, the heavy encumbrance to the guide,
I was drenched to the skin in about two minutes. This
was a comfort. It settled the point. I dislike uncertainty.
I could be at my ease, and look about. Remember
it was yet August.</p>

<p>And the Val de Jéret, up which I was riding, was so
grandly gloomy; the state of the weather excluding
all but close views! My note-book thus speaks of it, the
writer never dreaming that his impressions would be
told to the readers of a newspaper, with many of whom
Niagara and Montmorenci are familiar sights: "The
valley presents a succession of splendid waterfalls; and,
singularly enough, as your route lies upwards, they increase
in size and beauty, from the Mahourat, the first,
to the Pont d'Espagne, the last and most celebrated.
The three intervening, that are dignified with names,
are the Cérizet, the Boussé, and the Pas de l'Ours.
Besides these, there are an infinity of smaller falls, the
whole course of the Gave (or torrent) de Marcadaou&mdash;along
which the path lies&mdash;boiling over broken masses
of rock. The eye is charmed by endless variety, amid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
perpetual repetition. The deluge of rain, which covered
the lofty rocks on each side of the defile with clouds,
had gloriously swollen the turbulent waters. I know
of nothing in natural scenery&mdash;thus the manuscript
rather enthusiastically proceeds&mdash;that impresses one so
forcibly as a cascade of large dimensions. By large I
mean broad, not lofty. The effect is apt to diminish,
with vast height. These, in the Val de Jéret, I found
absolutely bewitching; for is it not a sort of infatuation,
by which we are beguiled into drawing nearer and nearer,
until you almost touch the foaming sheets as they
flurry past, and are yourself driven back, for your pains,
half blind and breathless? One fine waterfall would
be enough to digest in a day. During these two or
three hours, I had a very feast of them."</p>

<p>If I extract this somewhat rhapsodical passage, it is
to show that my inward man was not dampened, by the
dampening process externally applied. On the contrary,
I am disposed to be jubilant, almost defiant, in
proportion to the fury of the storm; that is to say
when no serious personal inconvenience is caused by
stress of weather. In a mountain region too, above all
others, clouds play so great a part in the combination
of fine effects, that I have many times fairly welcomed
a tempestuous spell.</p>

<p>Thus from the Pont d'Espagne I continued my ride
an hour or so further, in order to reach the Lac de
Gaube, knowing perfectly well that the chances were
a hundred to one against my getting a glimpse of the
glaciers of the Vignemale, at whose feet this small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
sheet of water is imbedded. Small it may well be
termed, for it is not quite three miles in circumference,
though the largest lake in the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>On the rocky shore where the rough pathway terminates,
stands, or stood at the period of which I write,
a solitary hut. There, during the short summer season,
might be found a family who earned a scanty
subsistence, by catching the lake trout and serving them
up to chance travellers; by rowing, in the solitary
punt, any one who cared to paddle about the dark
waters; or by escorting any still more adventurous
stranger desirous of exploring the glaciers above-named,
or ascending the lower heights of the Vignemale.</p>

<p>Stepping up to the door of this cabin, I entered into
conversation with its chief occupant, who probably
combined in his own person the various offices of restaurateur,
fisherman, muleteer, guide, and smuggler.
Possibly I libel him in the last respect; but along that
frontier of France and Spain, it is rare to find a mountaineer
guiltless of the contraband trade.</p>

<p>A visitor on such a day was a welcome sight to the
poor fellow, who was eloquent in regrets that <i>his</i> mountain
and <i>his</i> glaciers and <i>his</i> other local points of interest
were all wrapped in the impenetrable mist. He
seemed, I remember now, to care more about it than
I did; for I had revelled in the exhibition of cascades,
and was rather tickled at the notion of having come
up to this lone and savage spot, where nothing whatever
was to be seen.</p>

<p>If a spirit had whispered me, that the moment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
my third <i>rencontre</i> was close at hand, I should have
smiled incredulously.</p>

<p>The fog lifted. I could see to a distance of half a
dozen yards.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"If Monsieur will give himself the trouble of walking
up to it, he will see."</p>

<p>It was on a jutting promontory of rock, close at
hand. A small enclosure was railed in. It held what
was obviously a monumental tablet, in white marble,
but discoloured by exposure.</p>

<p>"A favourite poodle, perhaps, of the Duchesse de
Berri&mdash;or one of our eccentric Englishmen doing honour
to a Pyrenean bear!" Such I thought it might
be, as I carelessly lounged up to it, and stooped to
read the inscription.</p>

<p>It was in French and English. I took no copy of
the words. But it was placed there in memory of Mr.
and Mrs. Easton, drowned in the lake, within one
month of their marriage, on the 20th of September,
18&mdash;! The facts were simply stated. I wish the record
of them had been placed a little further off from
the rendezvous of the thoughtless and light-hearted.</p>

<p>This was the last of my associations with her. But
it would not interest the reader, to be told with
what feelings of surprise and sorrow I thus learned the
close of a career, which bid so fair for happiness and
usefulness. Poor Mary Verner!</p>

<p>Before setting-off on my return to Cauterets, I
heard, from the lips of the man with whom I had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
conversing, the sad particulars of this harrowing event.
Never could the common phrase, that speaks of "painful
curiosity," have been more applicable than it was
in my case, as I stood and listened to him. Poor
fellow; he had been an eye-witness. He saw my
emotion. "Monsieur knew the young couple?"&mdash;thus
did he break the thread of his little narrative, more
than once.</p>

<p>I cannot pretend to set down his words. This is
the substance of what he told me.</p>

<p>The season was nearly over. The weather was
splendidly fine, but very cold. Travellers were scarcely
expected; when on that brilliant September morning,
up rode the bride and bridegroom. After resting
awhile, they took the single skiff that was there, Mr.
Easton offering to row his wife across the lake, to
which she very reluctantly assented. I recollect the
narrator dwelling on this fact.</p>

<p>The shore shelves off very rapidly. The water, in
some parts, reaches to the depth of three or four hundred
feet. At all times it is of marvellous clearness&mdash;as
I observed myself&mdash;and, except during the heats
of summer, so piercingly cold, as to be altogether unbearable
to the swimmer.</p>

<p>My informant helped them into the boat. Mr.
Easton was evidently used to the handling of oars.
The tragedy was immediately&mdash;perhaps one should
say, ostensibly&mdash;caused by those two qualities of the
water of the Lac de Gaube, to which I have just alluded&mdash;its
clearness and its coldness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The boat was at some considerable distance from
the shore. The boatman was watching them. Suddenly,
Mr. Easton paused in his rowing. He and his
wife looked over the side, as though guessing at the
depth. Mr. Easton then stood up, and plunged one
oar downwards into the water, with the confident action
of a man who is certain that he shall touch the
bottom. The transparency had deceived him. His
oar met no resistance; and he himself plunged heavily
overboard. Such at least was the impression of the
boatman on land; and he could scarcely be mistaken.</p>

<p>So far as he could see, Mr. Easton did not rise to
the surface. The cold numbed him, and he sunk, not
to rise again. The bereaved wife stood upright for a
moment in the boat, gazing on the water that had
swallowed up her husband before her eyes. Then she
too was seen to be in it; but not one of the two or
three, who witnessed the fearful sight, could tell whether
she threw herself in, or whether she fell in, senseless.
That secret will never be solved; and what
matters it to us, though the manner of the widowed
wife's death was so remarkable, that I cannot refrain
from mentioning it? In talking it over, they agreed
that she did not sink at all. As she fell, the water
inflated her dress, and she was buoyed-up, floating;
though there was no sign of life or movement on her
part, observable to the agonized spectators. After a
time&mdash;I forget whether it was half an hour, or half a
day&mdash;the remains of what once was loved as Mary
Verner were wafted tranquilly to the shore. Assis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>tance
also having been procured, Mr. Easton's body
was dragged-up from the bottom of the lake. One
grave in a church-yard in Essex now holds the coffins
of the ill-fated pair.</p>

<p>And was there no effort at rescue? Could nothing
be done? This idea will have crossed the reader's
mind. It suggested many questions to me, with which
I plied the boatman, who seemed to feel keenly in
them the bitterness of unintended reproach. But his
explanation&mdash;grievous as it was&mdash;was satisfactory.
There was no boat, no raft, no means of reaching the
spot. "Two of us," said he, "plunged up to our
necks into the water, in the irrepressible desire to
swim out to them; though we knew that it was certain
death to go beyond our depth. Besides, Monsieur,"
he added with touching simplicity, "I can't
help fancying that the poor lady was dead before she
fell out of the boat. Monsieur knew her; doesn't he
think that her heart was already broken?"</p>

<p>"God help her, and all of us, my brave friend; I
have not the smallest doubt of it!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<h2>TOSSING UP FOR A HUSBAND.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>From the French of Vicomte Ponson de Terrail.</i></p>

<h3>I.</h3>


<p>The Marchioness was at her toilet. Florine and
Aspasia, her two ladies'-maids, were busy powdering,
as it were with hoar-frost, the bewitching widow.</p>

<p>She was a widow, this Marchioness, a widow of
twenty-three; and wealthy, as very few persons were
any longer at the court of Louis XV., her godfather.</p>

<p>Three-and-twenty years earlier, his Majesty had
held her at the baptismal font of the chapel at Marly,
and had settled upon her an income of a hundred thousand
livres, by way of proving to her father, the Baron
Fontevrault, who had saved his life in the battle of
Fontenoy, that kings can be grateful, whatever
people choose to say to the contrary.</p>

<p>The Marchioness then was a widow. She resided
during the summer, in a charming little chateau, situated
half-way up the slope overhanging the water, on
the road from Bougival to Saint Germain. Madame
Dubarry's estate adjoined hers; and on opening her
eyes she could see, without rising, the white gable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>ends
and the white-spreading chestnut-trees of Luciennes,
perched upon the heights. On this particular
day&mdash;it was noon&mdash;the Marchioness, whilst her attendants
dressed her hair and arranged her head-dress
with the most exquisite taste, gravely employed herself
in tossing up, alternately, a couple of fine oranges,
which crossed each other in the air, and then dropped
into the white and delicate hand that caught them in
their fall.</p>

<p>This sleight-of-hand&mdash;which the Marchioness interrupted
at times whilst she adjusted a beauty-spot on
her lip, or cast an impatient glance on the crystal
clock that told how time was running away with the
fair widow's precious moments&mdash;had lasted for ten
minutes, when the folding-doors were thrown open,
and a valet, such as one sees now only on the stage
announced with pompous voice&mdash;"The King!"</p>

<p>Apparently, the Marchioness was accustomed to
such visits, for she but half rose from her seat, as she
saluted with her most gracious smile the personage
who entered.</p>

<p>It was indeed Louis XV. himself&mdash;Louis XV. at
sixty-five; but robust, upright, with smiling lip and
beaming eye, and jauntily clad in a close-fitting, pearl-grey
hunting-suit, that became him to perfection. He
carried under his arm a handsome fowling-piece, inlaid
with mother-of-pearl; a small pouch, intended for
ammunition alone, hung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The King had come from Luciennes, almost alone,
that is but with a Captain of the Guard, the old Mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>shal
de Richelieu, and a single Equerry on foot. He
had been amusing himself with quail-shooting, loading
his own gun, as was the fashion with his ancestors, the
later Valois and the earlier Bourbons. His grandsire,
Henry IV., could not have been less ceremonious.</p>

<p>But a shower of hail had surprised him; and his
Majesty had no relish for it. He pretended that the
fire of an enemy's battery was less disagreeable than
those drops of water, so small and so hard, that wet
him through, and reminded him of his twinges of rheumatism.</p>

<p>Fortunately, he was but a few steps from the gateway
of the chateau, when the shower commenced. He
had come therefore to take shelter with his god-daughter,
having dismissed his suite, and only keeping with
him a magnificent pointer, whose genealogy was fully
established by the Duc de Richelieu, and traced
back, with a few slips in orthography, directly to Nisus,
that celebrated greyhound, given by Charles IX. to
his friend Ronsard, the poet.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Marchioness," said the King, as
he entered, putting down his fowling-piece in a corner.
"I have come to ask your hospitality. We were
caught in a shower at your gate&mdash;Richelieu and I.
I have packed off Richelieu."</p>

<p>"Ah, Sire, that wasn't very kind of you."</p>

<p>"Hush!" replied the King, in a good-humored tone.
"It's only mid-day; and if the Marshal had forced his
way in here at so early an hour, he would have bragged
of it every where, this very evening. He is very apt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to compromise one, and he is a great coxcomb too,
the old Duke. But don't put yourself out of the way,
Marchioness. Let Aspasia finish this becoming pile
of your head-dress, and Florine spread out with her
silver knife the scented powder that blends so well
with the lilies and the roses of your bewitching face....
Why, Marchioness, you are so pretty, one could eat
you up!"</p>

<p>"You think me so, Sire?"</p>

<p>"I tell you so every day. Oh, what fine oranges!"</p>

<p>And the King seated himself upon the roomy sofa,
by the side of the Marchioness, whose rosy finger-tips
he kissed with an infinity of grace. Then taking up
one of the oranges that he had admired, he proceeded
leisurely to examine it.</p>

<p>"But," said he at length, "what are oranges doing
by the side of your Chinese powder-box and your scent
bottles? Is there any connection between this fruit
and the maintenance&mdash;easy as it is, Marchioness&mdash;of
your charms?"</p>

<p>"These oranges," replied the lady, gravely, "fulfilled
just now, Sire, the functions of destiny."</p>

<p>The King opened wide his eyes, and stroked the
long ears of his dog, by way of giving the Marchioness
time to explain her meaning.</p>

<p>"It was the Countess who gave them to me," she
continued.</p>

<p>"Madame Dubarry?"</p>

<p>"Exactly so, Sire."</p>

<p>"A trumpery gift, it seems to me, Marchioness."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hold it, on the contrary, to be an important one;
since I repeat to your Majesty, that these oranges
decide my fate."</p>

<p>"I give it up," said the King.</p>

<p>"Imagine, Sire; yesterday I found the Countess
occupied in tossing her oranges up and down, in this
way." And the Marchioness recommenced her game
with a skill that cannot be described.</p>

<p>"I see," said the King; "she accompanied this
singular amusement with the words, 'Up, Choiseul!
up, Praslin!' and, on my word, I can fancy how the
pair jumped."</p>

<p>"Precisely so, Sire."</p>

<p>"And do you dabble in politics, Marchioness? Have
you a fancy for uniting with the Countess, just to mortify
my poor ministers?"</p>

<p>"By no means, Sire; for, in place of Monsieur de
Choiseul and the Duc de Praslin, I was saying to
myself, just now, 'Up, Menneval! up, Beaugency!'"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," returned the King; "and why the deuce
would you have them jumping, those two good-looking
gentlemen&mdash;Monsieur de Menneval, who is a Croesus,
and Monsieur de Beaugency, who is a statesman, and
dances the minuet to perfection?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," said the dame. "You know, Sire,
that Monsieur de Menneval is an accomplished gentleman,
a handsome man, a gallant cavalier, an indefatigable
dancer, witty as Monsieur Arouet, and longing
for nothing so much as to live in the country, on his
estate in Touraine, on the banks of the Loire, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the woman whom he loves or will love, far from the
court, from grandeur, and from turmoil."</p>

<p>"And, on my life, he's in the right of it," quoth
the King. "One does become so wearied at court."</p>

<p>"Aye, and no," rejoined the widow as she put on
her last beauty-spot.... "Nor are you unaware,
Sire, that Monsieur de Beaugency is one of the most
brilliant courtiers of Marly and Versailles; ambitious,
burning with zeal for the service of your Majesty; as
brave as Monsieur de Menneval, and capable of going
to the end of the earth ... with the title of Ambassador
of the King of France."</p>

<p>"I know that," chimed in Louis XV., with a laugh.
"But, alas, I have more ambassadors than embassies.
My ante-chambers overflow every morning."</p>

<p>"Now," continued the Marchioness, "I have been
a widow ... these two years past."</p>

<p>"A long time, there's no denying."</p>

<p>"Ah," sighed she, "there's no need to tell me so,
Sire. But Monsieur de Menneval loves me ... at
least he says so, and I am easily persuaded."</p>

<p>"Very well; then marry Monsieur de Menneval."</p>

<p>"I have thought of it, Sire; and, in truth, I might
do much worse. I should like well enough to live in
the country, under the willow-trees, on the borders of
the river, with a husband, fond, yielding, loving, who
would detest the philosophers and set some little value
on the poets. When no external noises disturb the
honey-moon, that month, Sire, may be indefinitely pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>longed.
In the country, you know, one never hears a
noise."</p>

<p>"Unless it be the north-wind moaning in the corridor,
and the rain pattering on the window-panes."
And the King shivered slightly on his sofa.</p>

<p>"But," added the dame, "Monsieur de Beaugency
loves me equally well."</p>

<p>"Ah, ah! the ambitious man!"</p>

<p>"Ambition does not shut out love, Sire. Monsieur
de Beaugency is a Marquis; he is twenty-five; he is
ambitious&mdash;I should like a husband vastly who was
longing to reach high offices of state. Greatness has
its own particular merit."</p>

<p>"Then marry Monsieur de Beaugency."</p>

<p>"I have thought of that, also; but this poor Monsieur
de Menneval."...</p>

<p>"Very good," exclaimed the King, laughing: "now
I see to what purpose the oranges are destined. Monsieur
de Menneval pleases you; Monsieur de Beaugency
would suit you just as well; and since one can't
have more than one husband, you make them each jump
in turn."</p>

<p>"Just so, Sire. But observe what happens."</p>

<p>"Ah, what does happen?"</p>

<p>"That, unwilling and unable to play unfairly, I take
equal pains to catch the two oranges as they come
down; and that I catch them both, each time."</p>

<p>"Well, are you willing that I should take part in
your game?"</p>

<p>"You, Sire? Ah, what a joke that would be!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am very clumsy, Marchioness. To a certainty,
in less than three minutes Beaugency and Menneval,
will be rolling on the floor."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the lady; "and if you have any
preference for one or the other?"</p>

<p>"No; we'll do better. Look, I take the two oranges ... you
mark them carefully&mdash;or, better still,
you stick into one of them one of these toilet pins,
making up your own mind which of the two is to represent
Monsieur de Beaugency, and leaving me, on that
point, entirely in the dark. If Monsieur de Beaugency
touches the floor, you shall marry his rival; if it
happen just otherwise, you shall resign yourself to become
an ambassadress."</p>

<p>"Excellent! Now, Sire, let's see the result."</p>

<p>The King took the two oranges and plied shuttle
with them above his head. But at the third pass, the
two rolled down upon the embroidered carpet, and the
Marchioness broke out into a merry fit of laughter.</p>

<p>"I foresaw as much," exclaimed his Majesty.
"What a clumsy fellow I am!"</p>

<p>"And we more puzzled than ever, Sire?"</p>

<p>"So we are, Marchioness; but the best thing we
can do, is to slice the oranges, sugar them well, and
season them with a dash of West India rum. Then
you can beg me to taste them, and offer me some of
those preserved cherries and peaches that you put up
just as nicely as my daughter Adelaide."</p>

<p>"And Monsieur de Menneval? and Monsieur de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Beaugency?" said the Marchioness, in piteous accents.
"How is the question to be settled?"</p>

<p>Louis XV. began to cogitate.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure," said he, "that both of them
are in love with you?"</p>

<p>"Probably so," returned she, with a little coquettish
smile, sent back to her from the mirror opposite.</p>

<p>"And their love is equally strong?"</p>

<p>"I trust so, Sire."</p>

<p>"And I don't believe a word of it."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Marchioness, "but that is, in truth,
a most terrible supposition. Besides, Sire, they are
on their way hither."</p>

<p>"Both of them?"</p>

<p>"One after the other: the Marquis at one o'clock
precisely; the Baron at two. I promised them my
decision to-morrow, on condition that they would pay
me a final visit to-day."</p>

<p>As the Marchioness finished, the valet, who had
announced the King, came to inform his mistress,
that Monsieur de Beaugency was in the drawing-room,
and solicited the favour of admission to pay his respects.</p>

<p>"Capital!" said Louis XV., smiling as though he
were eighteen; "show Monsieur de Beaugency in.
Marchioness, you will receive him, and tell him the
price that you set upon your hand."</p>

<p>"And what is the price, Sire?"</p>

<p>"You must give him the choice&mdash;either to renounce
you, or to consent to send in to me his resignation of
his appointments, in order that he may go and bury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
himself with his wife on his estate of Courlac, in Poitou,
there to live the life of a country gentleman."</p>

<p>"And then, Sire?"</p>

<p>"You will allow him a couple of hours for reflection,
and so dismiss him."</p>

<p>"And in the end?"</p>

<p>"The rest is my concern." And the King got up,
taking his dog and his gun, and concealed himself behind
a screen, drawing also a curtain, that he might
be completely hidden.</p>

<p>"What is your intention, Sire?" asked the Marchioness.</p>

<p>"I conceal myself like the kings of Persia, from the
eyes of my subjects," replied Louis XV. "Hush,
Marchioness."</p>

<p>A few moments later, and Monsieur de Beaugency
entered the room.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>


<p>The Marquis was a charming cavalier; tall, slight,
with a moustache black and curling upwards, an eye
sparkling and intelligent, a Roman nose, an Austrian
lip, a firm step, a noble and imposing presence.</p>

<p>The Marchioness blushed slightly, at sight of him,
but offered him her hand to kiss; and as she begged
him by a gesture to be seated, thus inwardly took
counsel with herself.</p>

<p>"Decidedly, I believe that the test is useless; it is
Monsieur de Beaugency whom I love. How proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
shall I be to lean upon his arm at the court-fêtes!
With what delight shall I keep long watches in the
cabinet of his Excellency the Ambassador, whilst he
is busy with his Majesty's affairs!"</p>

<p>But after this "aside," the Marchioness resumed
her gracious and coquettish air; as though the woman
comprehended the mission of refined gallantry which
was reserved for her seductive and delicate epoch by
an indulgent Providence, that laid by its anger and
its evil days for the subsequent reign.</p>

<p>"Marchioness," said Monsieur de Beaugency, as he
held in his hands the rosy fingers of the lovely widow,
"it is fully a week since you received me!"</p>

<p>"A week? why, you were here yesterday!"</p>

<p>"Then I must have counted the hours for ages."</p>

<p>"A compliment which may be found in one of the
younger Crebillon's books!"</p>

<p>"You are hard upon me, Marchioness."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, ... it comes naturally ... I am
tired."</p>

<p>"Ah, Marchioness! Heaven knows that I would
make of your existence one never-ending fête!"</p>

<p>"That would, at least, be wearisome."</p>

<p>"Say a word, Madam, one single word, and my
fortune, my future prospects, my ambition!"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are still then as ambitious as ever?"</p>

<p>"More than ever, since I have been in love with
you."</p>

<p>"Is that necessary?"</p>

<p>"Beyond a doubt. Ambition&mdash;what is it but hon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>ours,
wealth, the envious looks of impotent rivals, the
admiration of the crowd, the favour of monarchs?...
And is not one's love unanswerably and most triumphantly
proved, in laying all this at the feet of the
woman whom one adores?"</p>

<p>"You may be right."</p>

<p>"I may be right, Marchioness! Listen to me, my
fair lady-love."</p>

<p>"I am all attention, sir."</p>

<p>"Between us, who are well-born, and consort not
with plebeians, that vulgar and sentimental sort of
love, which is painted by those who write books for
your mantuamakers and chambermaids, would be in
exceedingly bad taste. It would be but slighting love
and making no account of its enjoyments, were we to
go and bury it in some obscure corner of the Provinces,
or of Paris&mdash;we, who belong to Versailles&mdash;living
away there with it, in monotonous solitude and unchanging
contemplation!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Marchioness, "you think so?"</p>

<p>"Tell me, rather, of fêtes that dazzle one with
lights, with noise, with smiles, with wit, through
which one glides intoxicated, with the fair conquest
in triumph on one's arm ... why hide one's happiness,
in place of parading it? The jealousy of the world
does but increase, and cannot diminish it. My uncle,
the Cardinal, stands well at court. He has the King's
ear, and better still, the Countess's. He will, ere
long, procure me one of the Northern embassies.
Cannot you fancy yourself Madame the Ambassadress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
treading the platform of a drawing-room, as royalty
with royalty, with the highest nobility of a kingdom&mdash;having
the men at your feet, and the women on lower
seats around you, whilst you yourself are occupant of
a throne, and wield a sceptre?"</p>

<p>And as Monsieur de Beaugency warmed with his
own eloquence, he gently slid from his seat to the
knees of the Marchioness, whose hand he covered with
kisses.</p>

<p>She listened to him, with a smile on her lips, and
then abruptly said to him:</p>

<p>"Rise, sir, and hear me in turn. Are you in truth
sincerely attached to me?"</p>

<p>"With my whole soul, Marchioness!"</p>

<p>"Are you prepared to make every sacrifice?"</p>

<p>"Every one, Madam."</p>

<p>"That is fortunate indeed; for to be prepared for
all, is to accomplish one, without the slightest difficulty;
and it is but a single one that I require."</p>

<p>"Oh, speak! Must a throne be conquered?"</p>

<p>"By no means, sir. You must only call to mind
that you own a fine chateau in Poitou."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Monsieur de Beaugency, "a shed."</p>

<p>"Every man's house is his castle," replied the widow.
"And having called it to mind, you need only order
post-horses."</p>

<p>"For what purpose?"</p>

<p>"To carry me off to Courlac. It is there that your
almoner shall unite us, in the chapel, in presence of
your domestics and your vassals, our only witnesses."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"A singular whim, Marchioness; but I submit to it."</p>

<p>"Very well. We will set out this evening.... Ah!
I forgot."</p>

<p>"What, further?"</p>

<p>"Before starting, you will send in your resignation
to the King."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Beaugency almost bounded from his
seat.</p>

<p>"Do you dream of that, Marchioness?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly. You will not, at Courlac, be able to
perform your duties at court."</p>

<p>"And on returning?"</p>

<p>"We will not return."</p>

<p>"We will&mdash;not&mdash;return!" slowly ejaculated Monsieur
de Beaugency. "Where then shall we proceed?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere. We will remain at Courlac."</p>

<p>"All the winter?"</p>

<p>"And all the summer. I count upon settling myself
there, after our marriage. I have a horror of the
court. I do not like the turmoil. Grandeur wearies
me.... I look forward only to a simple and charming
country life, to the tranquil and happy existence of the
forgotten lady of the castle.... What matters it to you?
You were ambitious for my love's sake. I care but
little for ambition; you ought to care for it still less,
since you are in love with me."</p>

<p>"But, Marchioness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! it's a bargain.... Still, for form's sake, I
give you one hour to reflect. There, pass out that way;
go into the winter drawing-room that you will find at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the end of the gallery, and send me your answer upon
a leaf of your tablets. I am about to complete my
toilet, which I left unfinished, to receive you."</p>

<p>And the Marchioness opened a door, bowed Monsieur
de Beaugency into the corridor, and closed the door
upon him.</p>

<p>"Marchioness," cried the King, from his hiding place
and through the screen, "you will offer Monsieur
de Menneval the embassy to Prussia, which I promise
you for him."</p>

<p>"And you will not emerge from your retreat?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Madame; it is far more amusing to
remain behind the scenes. One hears all, laughs at
one's ease, and is not troubled with saying any thing."</p>

<p>It struck two. Monsieur de Menneval was announced.
His Majesty remained snug, and shammed dead.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>


<p>Monsieur de Menneval was, at all points, a cavalier
who yielded nothing to his rival, Monsieur de Beaugency.
He was fair. He had a blue eye, a broad forehead,
a mouth that wore a dreamy expression, and that
somewhat pensive air which became so well the Troubadours
of France in the olden time.</p>

<p>We cannot say whether Monsieur de Menneval had
perpetrated verse; but he loved the poets, the arts, the
quiet of the fields, the sunsets, the rosy dawn, the breeze
sighing through the foliage, the low and mysterious
tones of a harp, sounding at eve from the light bark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
shooting over the blue waters of the Loire&mdash;all things
in short that harmonize with that melodious concert of
the heart, which passes by the name of love.</p>

<p>He was timid, but he passionately loved the beautiful
widow; and his dearest dream was of passing his
whole life at her feet, in well chosen retirement, far
from those envious lookers-on who are ever ready to
fling their sarcasms on quiet happiness, and who dissemble
their envy under cloak of a philosophic scepticism.</p>

<p>He trembled, as he entered the Marchioness's boudoir.
He remained standing before her, and blushed as
he kissed her hand. At length, encouraged by a smile,
emboldened by the solemnity of this coveted interview,
he spoke to her of his love, with a poetic simplicity and
an unpremeditated warmth of heart&mdash;the genuine enthusiasm
of a priest, who has faith in the object of his
adoration.</p>

<p>And as he spoke, the Marchioness sighed, and said
within herself:</p>

<p>"He is right. Love is happiness. Love is to be
two indeed, but one at the same time; and to be free
from those importunate intermeddlers, the indifference
or the mocking attention of the world."</p>

<p>She remembered, however, the advice of the King,
and thus addressed the Baron:</p>

<p>"What will you indeed do, in order to convince me
of your affection?"</p>

<p>"All that man can do."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The Baron was less bold than Monsieur de Beaugency,
who had talked of conquering a throne. He
was probably more sincere.</p>

<p>"I am ambitious," said the widow.</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied Monsieur de Menneval, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"And I would that the man, whom I marry, should
aspire to every thing, and achieve every thing."</p>

<p>"I will try so to do, if you wish it."</p>

<p>"Listen; I give you an hour to reflect. I am, you
know, the King's god-daughter. I have begged of him
an embassy for you."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Monsieur de Menneval, with indifference.</p>

<p>"He has granted my request. If you love me, you
will accept the offer. We will be married this evening,
and your Excellency the Ambassador to Prussia will
set off for Berlin immediately after the nuptials. Reflect;
I grant you an hour."</p>

<p>"It is useless," answered Monsieur de Menneval;
"I have no need of reflection, for I love you. Your
wishes are my orders: to obey you is my only desire.
I accept the embassy."</p>

<p>"Never mind!" said she, trembling with joy and
blushing deeply. "Pass into the room, wherein you
were just now waiting. I must complete my toilet,
and I shall then be at your service. I will summon
you."</p>

<p>The Marchioness handed out the Baron by the right-hand
door, as she had handed out the Marquis by the
left; and then said to herself:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall be prettily embarrassed, if Monsieur de
Beaugency should consent to end his days at Courlac!"</p>

<p>Thereupon, the King removed the screen and reappeared.</p>

<p>His Majesty stepped quietly to the round table,
whereupon he had replaced the oranges, and took up
one of them.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the Marchioness, "I perceive,
Sire, that you foresee the difficulty that is about to
spring up, and go back accordingly to the oranges, in
order to settle it."</p>

<p>As his sole reply, Louis XV. took a small ivory handled
pen-knife from his waistcoat pocket, made an
incision in the rind of the orange, peeled it off very
neatly, divided the fruit into two parts, and offered
one to the astonished Marchioness.</p>

<p>"But, Sire, what are you doing?" was her eager
inquiry.</p>

<p>"You see that I am eating the orange."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was of no manner of use to us."</p>

<p>"You have decided then?"</p>

<p>"Unquestionably. Monsieur de Menneval loves
you better than Monsieur de Beaugency."</p>

<p>"That is not quite certain yet; let us wait."</p>

<p>"Look," said the King, pointing to the valet, who
entered with a note from the Marquis, "You'll soon
see."</p>

<p>The widow opened the note, and read:</p>

<p>"Madam, I love you&mdash;Heaven is my witness; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
to give you up is the most cruel of sacrifices. But I
am a gentleman. A gentleman belongs to the King.
My life, my blood are his. I cannot, without forfeit
of my loyalty, abandon his service&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Et cetera," chimed in the King, "as was observed
by the Abbé Fleury, my tutor. Marchioness, call in
Monsieur de Menneval."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Menneval entered, and was greatly
troubled to see the King in the widow's boudoir.</p>

<p>"Baron," said his Majesty, "Monsieur de Beaugency
was deeply in love with the Marchioness; but
he was more deeply still in love&mdash;since he would not
renounce it, to please her&mdash;with the embassy to Prussia.
And you, you love the Marchioness so much better
than you love me, that you would only enter my service
for her sake. This leads me to believe that you
would be but a lukewarm public servant, and that
Monsieur de Beaugency will make an excellent ambassador.
He will start for Berlin this evening; and
you shall marry the Marchioness. I will be present
at the ceremony."</p>

<p>"Marchioness," whispered Louis XV. in the ear of
his god-daughter, "true love is that which does not
shrink from a sacrifice."</p>

<p>And the King peeled the second orange and eat
it, as he placed the hand of the widow in that of the
Baron.</p>

<p>"I have been making three persons happy: the
Marchioness, whose indecision I have relieved; the
Baron, who shall marry her; and Monsieur do Beau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>gency,
who will perchance prove a sorry ambassador.
In all this, I have only neglected my own interests,
for I have been eating the oranges without sugar....
And yet they pretend to say that I am a selfish Monarch?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE MISSING MARINERS,</h2>

<p class="center">A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">This fanciful sketch was written and published, before the fate of Sir John
Franklin and his Discovery Ships was known.</p></blockquote>


<p>There was not a curtain of any kind over the window.</p>

<p>Now, there are few things that I dislike more than
this total want of privacy in a bed-room. Opposite to
a dead wall at a foot's distance, so that none but bogies
could peer within, or looking out through a port-hole
over the lonely sea, I confess to an almost old-maidenish
particularity in this respect. Failing, therefore, in
sundry efforts to substitute a great coat for a curtain,
or even to delude myself into a sense of seclusion, by
planting an open umbrella upon a chair before the
window, I finally abandoned my efforts, determined to
brazen it out, blew out my light, and tumbled into
bed, not in the best of humours.</p>

<p>You remember, perhaps, the bitter cold night and
the flurry of a snow storm, that came abruptly upon us,
a few weeks since. That was the time of which I
write&mdash;the place was a country village. And what
a freezing night it was! The east wind blew gustily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and drearily. It was moonlight, but dull and grey;
and as I lay in bed, without raising my head from the
starveling bolster vainly eked out by a meagre carpet
bag, I could see a single pine tree, on a steep bank
right opposite my window, nodding, and bowing at me
by fits and by starts, as though the capricious spirit
of the night wind had bid it mock me. How I longed
for the sight of a chimney-pot!</p>

<p>There was no snow yet; but I listened to the rush
of each driving blast, and shrunk, huddling under the
clothes, from the chill it sent through me, as its keen
edges forced their way through the crevices of the
roof over my head. At length, and after much tumbling
and tossing, I fell asleep&mdash;or believed that I did
so; and presently I awoke again&mdash;or so it seemed to
me. What was sleeping, and what was waking, I
scarcely knew, that night.</p>

<p>Suddenly, there, between us&mdash;between myself, I
mean, and the white, shining hill-side&mdash;came an object,
undefined in form but palpable in substance, waving
gently to and fro, passing and repassing before the
window, and at last appearing almost to touch it.
Finally it became stationary there, yet still undulating
with that soft tremulous motion which you may have
noticed in the humming-bird, when, poised upon his
delicate wings, he darts his slender tongue into the
petals of a favourite flower. "What in the world is
it?" I exclaimed; and had just fancied that I could
see a few slight cords reaching from it upwards, above
the upper edge of the window, when I distinctly heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
a rap upon the pane, and sprung from my bed, in
wonderment, but not in fear. The glass melted away&mdash;frame-work
to the casement there was none&mdash;I
passed outwards, unconscious how or wherefore. I was
seated, warmly and comfortably seated, springing aloft
into the moonlit and starry sky.</p>

<p>Then I knew that it was a balloon. It rose at the
instant, and sped rapidly through the air. The wind
was strong, but blowing a steady gale; not in gusts
now, as it had been. And I felt that it was from the
south, for it was soft and balmy; and I knew that I
was driving towards the Polar star, for I saw it; and
saw it growing larger and more luminous.</p>

<p>Then my spirit yearned after the missing Mariners;
and I prayed Heaven that I might be on my way to
find them.</p>

<p>On we sped; but I was conscious, though the southerly
gales were wafting me to the frozen regions of
the North, that there was a spirit beneath or behind
me, guiding the tiny car in which I was borne. I
felt that he was there, though I strove in vain to
detect his presence. Slily did I glance over my shoulder,
abruptly did I turn my head, cautiously did I
crane over the edge&mdash;I could not see him. I felt
him directing my looks to what I beheld, shaping my
thoughts whitherward they went; but it pleased him
to remain invisible.</p>

<p>It was yet night. Many rivers did we cross in our
progress, some looking inky-black as they flowed between
snowy banks, others dimly made out, and lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in the one unvaried tone. Lakes were there, too,
and cities sparcely scattered. The latter were mostly
slumbering in the same quiet as the former; but
ascending from one I heard the alarm of a bell, and
glanced downwards at a herd of figures who seemed
to be fussing and fuming around a fire.</p>

<p>And now, for a moment, I knew that I was dreaming;
and oh, grievous disappointment, I half awoke
to a consciousness that the vision was slipping away
from me. How I clutched at it! how I hugged it,
and refused to have a word to say to my senses! Did
you never try this plan and succeed in it? If not, I
would not give a fig for your dreams.</p>

<p>But I caught up the thread of mine. Bravo! It
was a narrow escape, though. They told me, next
day, that there had been a false alarm of fire in the
village, during the night. I would have been roasted
alive, rather than not have dreamed out my dream.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Day-light, and early summer, and we were hovering
over the icy land and icy sea, scarcely now distinguishable,
one from other. Nor can I, indeed, describe
much of what I saw; for methought, that we were
driving hither and thither, not only in the dreary realm
of the Frost-king, but up, and down, and athwart
the ordinary current of times and seasons. So was
there much confusion. Anon it was that awful
Winter, whose cold will eat, like red-hot iron, into the
unguarded flesh, or more fatal still, will palm off Death
upon his victim under the alluring disguise of Slum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>ber&mdash;Winter,
with his terrible silence, more fearful
than the roar of his fiercest hurricanes&mdash;Winter, with
his blinding mantle of unbroken white, and his snowdrifts
wherein cities might be engulphed&mdash;Winter,
with his one redeeming beauty, one attendant goddess,
one Aurora, the Borealis, whose coruscations
were so marvellous to behold, so changeful, so grand,
so brilliant, that I smiled in looking on them, to think
that ever human skill had fabricated fire-works, and
that their display could throw spectators into ecstacies.</p>

<p>And anon it was the Arctic summer&mdash;and the blue
waters peeped at intervals between giant pyramids of
ice&mdash;pyramids, and pinnacles, and turrets, and all
shapely and all shapeless masses. And these were
floating in the sunlight&mdash;some majestically sailing
through the ever opening spaces, coming never in
contact with their fellows&mdash;others jarring, and crashing,
and splintering into a thousand fragments, as the
upheaving waves compelled them perilously to embrace
each other; and their greeting was as the
roar of thunder-storms. And uncouth walrusses
were playing their clumsy antics on detached fragments
of the ice, and the seal was basking in the
sun, and the huge whale was spouting, and the seagull
was skimming the surface of the loosened deep,
dipping therein the tips of his wings, as though to assure
himself that it was indeed liquid. Landward,
too&mdash;for there was land, also, beneath us&mdash;I seemed
to see the scanty blades of a dwarfish vegetation thrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>ing
themselves pertinaciously through the snow; and
anon the garb of the earth seemed changing from one
universal white, to varied hues of brown and green.</p>

<p>Those things and other such, rare and beautiful,
were visible to the bodily eye; but the eye of my
mind was not therewith content. It strained its
utmost, but saw not what it longed for; and my voice
broke out in bitterness, "Oh, the ships and the men,
the men and the ships, the good Sir John and his
daring crews!"</p>

<p>Then I was conscious that my attendant spirit impelled
the balloon in a direction hitherto unexplored,
and lo! there beneath us was a ship&mdash;a ship, one of
the objects of my search!</p>

<p>A ship! and my heart bounded within me at the first
glimpse I caught of it. But ah! how the blood curdled
in my veins, when, at the next moment, I saw that
the ship had not, and could not have occupants. Poor,
ill-fated, ill-treated vessel; never surely did typhoon
or whirlwind so displace thee from thy proper bearings.
The troubled waters of the Atlantic or the Caribbean
Sea might indeed have reared thee upwards, and plunged
thee downwards, and made thee reel to and fro,
like a drunkard; but it was alone the frozen waters of
the Arctic, that could have forced thee into this unnatural
position, and then cruelly nailed thee there, to
rot into decay.</p>

<p>Ay, stout ship <i>Erebus</i> or <i>Terror</i>&mdash;I wot not which&mdash;there
wert thou lying, or rather there didst thou
stand upright, thy bows grovelling in the ice, thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
stern uplifted high in air, thy keel propped up against
a sheer precipice of ice, thy bowsprit shivered into
splinters, thy masts and yards, and tackle, fallen all,
and tangled in most inextricable confusion. One stick
alone remained set out horizontally from the deck.
From it drooped the tattered remnant of a flag; it was
the blood-red standard of England!</p>

<p>As the balloon glided downwards towards the wreck, I
could have peered into the after-cabin windows; but a
single glance had already satisfied me that no living
being would be found on board. I have said that my
blood curdled in my veins. Turning hastily with a
sudden movement of indignation, I obtained a moment's
glance at my guide&mdash;his form was shadowy;
but by his hideous features I recognized him as Despair,
and felt that he and I were one.</p>

<p>But ho, a pleasant change! Down we floated, till
my tiny car was almost on a level with the vessel's
bows; and there&mdash;oh, joy of joys&mdash;were signs, palpable
and undoubted, that the crew had fared better
than their ship&mdash;that they had escaped, and were
gone, and had carried what they pleased away with
them. At one view I comprehended this&mdash;I read it
in the aperture sawn through the doubled planking,
and in the fragments of casks and cases with which the
ice was bestrewn around. There was a board, too,
with writing upon it, nailed up conspicuously; but I
tried in vain to decipher it. Under the impulse of
strong excitement, I again turned abruptly toward my
guide; this time, I could not obtain a glimpse of him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Methought, however, that I heard a rustle like the
sound of wings, and that the inflated silk over my
head became suddenly tinted with the hues of the
rainbow. And so I knew that I was under the guidance
of Hope; and that Despair would trouble me no
more. Whither my countrymen were gone I could
not conjecture; but, at least, I deemed them safe.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Away, and away, we soared upwards and sped onwards;
how far, and how long, I marked not. And
lo, another object! not a ship&mdash;it is a house, this time;
yes, a house in the lonely wilderness of that frozen
ocean, a hut upon the waves of that boundless <i>mer de
glace</i>. And it was fashioned in rude form; and the
material was rough blocks of ice; and snow seemed to
have been used as their cement. The roof was formed
by poles and spars; and across them yet hung a sailcloth
covering. Roundabout the hut was a lofty wall,
built apparently to shelter it from storms, and snowdrifts;
and the wall was built with the same material
as the house, for Nature's plentiful quarry fails not in
those Polar regions, if man's hand and man's axe be
brought there, to hew and shape. But for whom the
shelter, and whither had they gone, who tenanted it?
I knew well that the long lost had been here. None
but they&mdash;no miserable, wandering tribe of Esquimaux&mdash;could
have left such unmistakable marks of
forethought, and skill, and energy. Near by, too, was
plainly visible the icy cradle wherein a vessel had been
lying, and on an even keel. But ships and men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
gone&mdash;gone, but how gone, and whither? Earnestly
did I gaze for some solution of this mystery; and at
length I solved it, ay, plain enough; a line along the
surface of the ice became distinctly visible, rugged and
indented indeed, but straight, and stretching far away
to the Westward. Then was I assured that Sir John
and his brave comrades had been here, that they had
cut out a channel for their barque, and that the ice
had closed in behind them, so soon as they had passed
on their way. Yes, I was on their track. And again
I heard the soft rustling of the wings of Hope; and
the rainbow-tinted hues of the balloon were three-fold
more brilliant than before.</p>

<p>One other circumstance only could I note, ere we
sped away again upon the search&mdash;all who came hither
had not departed hence. Side by side, in a sheltered
nook, beneath a towering pinnacle of ice, two wooden
crosses, peering above the snow, told plainly that beneath
it two of the Mariners were sleeping in death.
And their names were rudely carved upon the crosses;
but again my sight, though in some respects preternaturally
sharpened, refused to satisfy my curiosity.
Never mind, thought I, 'tis a small proportion in so
large a company. We must all die once; and those
who rest here, rest as well as though they were laid
beneath the "long-drawn aisle;" and their bodies are
more enduringly embalmed by the servants of the great
Frost-King, than in olden days they could have been
by the hand of the cunning men of Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p><hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Upwards, and onwards, and steering ever a Westwardly
course. And lo, at length&mdash;oh, God be praised&mdash;yes
I found the men I sought! Yes&mdash;no more doubt&mdash;there
I saw them below me, although, with the caprice
incident to dreams, I was prevented from dropping
down in the midst of them, or rendering myself
either visible or audible.</p>

<p>A strange scene it was, independent of its surpassing
interest. Rocky islands&mdash;vast packs and floes of
ice&mdash;a lone ship beset, impeded, entangled&mdash;a hundred
pairs of lusty arms at work with ice-saws and axes,
striving to extricate her, by cutting a channel in the
direction where open water was visible. A little apart
from the busy groups stood one whom I instantly recognised
as the Chief. Care had furrowed his brow,
and somewhat whitened his locks, and bowed his vigorous
form; but manly resolution was stamped upon his
features, and command was in every gesture. Bethink
you how I strove to shout&mdash;how I struggled even to
throw myself down into their arms; but the dream-spell
was on me; I was invisible, perforce, and my
tongue refused to give utterance.</p>

<p>How I watched them! and look, the burly seaman
who is a few steps ahead of his comrades, tracking out
the pathway to be dug&mdash;look, he starts as though a
rattlesnake were issuing from the snow under his feet.
What is it? He stoops, and I see his big brown hand
tremble, as it assuredly would not have done, if picking
up a burning grenade. What is it, bold tar, that
moves thee thus? Ay, I see now, and know the cause,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
'tis yonder little slip of gay coloured silk on which are
printed a few short words. Jack could not read, it
was evident enough; but he held up his prize, and
called out something which I could not hear, and his
mess-mates bounded to the spot. Foremost in the race
was an athletic young man, in the threadbare uniform
of a Midshipman, who had left his father's halls, five
years ago, a beardless boy. Nor was the Chieftain
himself the last. How did it pass rapidly from hand
to hand, that little silken slip! How did its fall amongst
them seem to change the whole spirit of the scene!
But look again, a gesture from the Chief, not as one
of authority this time, but rather as one of suggestion.
It is obeyed, however, and a hundred heads are bared;
and by the movements of their lips, I could see that
every living man amongst them ejaculated a hearty
"amen" to the Chieftain's short but earnest thanksgiving
to Heaven, for the assistance now known to be
at hand. Then I remembered that the brave Sir John
was a pious and a God-fearing man; and that the
veriest infidel sneers not at religion in the mouth of
him, whose heart is fearless and true.</p>

<p>Visible to me, if not audible, what extravagant demonstrations
of joy ensued! I felt my little car vibrating
to their force, as cheers, peal upon peal, came
rolling up into the welkin. Singular was it, too, that
though in my dream my ears were stopped, I could
read in the expressive features of those rejoicing Mariners
their varied emotions, as they vociferated their
glee. I could see in their honest countenances, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
cheer was for Old England&mdash;which for their Queen&mdash;which
for their homes&mdash;which for their wives and
little ones. Then they burst forth into grotesque dancing,
and slapping of each others' hands, and jumping
on to each others' backs, and a thousand merry antics,
as though they were children just let loose from school.
And anon, in their mirth, running races hither and
thither, one, an officer amongst them, picked up another
printed silken slip, in general aspect like the
former, but addressed, it seemed, to the Chieftain by
name. A second look would have been sufficient to
master its contents, but the young man looked not the
second time, he hurried with it straightway to Sir
John. Rare instance this, methought, of the working
of a high sense of honour!</p>

<p>And the veteran, what did it convey to him? I
saw not; but I saw a tear course down his furrowed
cheek; and for the moment my ears were opened to
hear his half-smothered ejaculation, "Jane, Jane, God
bless thee&mdash;true wife, noble woman&mdash;we shall meet,
thank God, we shall meet!"</p>

<p>So I watched the merry throng, and strove in vain
to catch portions of their earnest talk. Suddenly, all
eyes were turned upon the Captain; he was speaking,
and pointing to the West. A few words only seemed
to come from his lips; but those surely were words of
command. In a moment, every man, though half
delirious with delight, seized upon his axe or his saw.
Work recommenced; labour was distributed in gangs.
Every arm was vigorously plied. The watch, des<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>cended
from the mast-head to hear the wondrous
tidings, mounted lustily again to his look-out station.
Each man was busy at his post; and though there was
perchance some display of increased energy and activity,
you would not have surmised that these patient
labourers had just exchanged the gathering gloom of
Despair for the radiant smiles of Hope. O gallant
hearts of oak, thought I&mdash;resolute, unflinching, enduring,
in the prospect of the dreariest of fates&mdash;orderly,
obedient, loyal, in the thrill of unexpected deliverance.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The remainder of my dream came upon me in
snatches.</p>

<p>Midway in a narrow strait, between lofty and sterile
banks, a battered and crippled barque was steering
South. I knew the place to be Behring's Straits, the
vessel the Discovery Ship that I had just left amidst
the ice. So bruised, however, was she, so rent, and
strained, and maltreated, that but for the friendly aid
of a consort's tow-rope, she could scarcely have adventured
even on this comparatively easy navigation.
At her peak floated the standard of England; but I
strove in vain to make out the colours of her welcome
escort. Once, I thought I saw plainly the Stars and
Stripes of America; but these either faded away, or
assumed the appearance of the double-headed eagle of
Russia. Be that as it may, my sense of hearing was
restored; and I could both hear and see signs of continuous
rejoicing and festivity. Sounds of mirth, and
song, and music, came upwards to me from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
pleasant waters. Many a canoe, too, filled with outlandish
people, visited the ships; all was wonder, and
delight, and congratulation.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Hitherto there had been some consistency in my
dream; for if my mode of seeing were dream-like and
fantastical, what I saw had the verisimilitude of reality.
But this was over, or at least was changed. In place
of being seated in the car of a balloon, I was now in
the maintop of Sir John's battered and leaky ship, a
witness to what could only have existence in the wild
imaginings of a vision. For, methought we were still
steering to the South, when on our larboard hand uprose
a range of lofty hills, upon which it seemed to me
that I could almost have jumped. Down their sides
rolled hundreds of little streams; and in the waters,
waist-deep, were myriads of human beings, delving,
and scraping, and washing, and picking up what seemed
to me to be gold. But they paused in their busy occupations,
when they saw the approach of the ships;
and, holding up shining masses of the golden ore, shouted
to the long missing mariners to come to the mines,
and gather a plentiful harvest after their toils. Yardarm
were we to the glittering hill-sides, and the miners
wore the air of men who rarely tempted in vain; but
the crew of the worn-out ship gaily shook their heads,
laughed a pleasant little laugh of defiance, and the
words, "home, home," came floating up to me from
her deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p><hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Another trial. The men had theirs, and were
staunch. It was the master's turn. Heading still to
the southwards, but almost becalmed, I saw a swift
steamer ranging fast up with us from astern. This
time the Stars and Stripes were plainly evident. She
came alongside. Her captain was on our deck in a
moment, and engaged in earnest conversation with the
good Sir John. By the wave of his hand and a word
caught here and there, I knew that the kindly American
was pressing the veteran to take passage in his
steamer. He drew a little almanac from his pocket,
and there seemed to be some comparison as to dates;
but Sir John finally, with a moistened eye, touched
the other on the shoulder, pointed upwards to the
British ensign, and firmly shook his head. Away
rushed the friendly steamer, and the crowding passengers
on her deck took leave of us with reiterated cheers.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>My dream was drawing to a close; but I yet was
housed snugly in my new position, when the look-out
at the mast-head announced a sail. It might have
been the same day, or the next, or a week later. But
he announced a sail&mdash;then another&mdash;and another&mdash;and
lastly a steamer under canvas. The squadron bore
down upon us. It consisted of two line-of-battle-ships,
a frigate, and a screw-propeller, under command of the
British Admiral in the Pacific. The greetings and
salutes were over, and official etiquette was somewhat
relaxed under the intense excitement of the moment,
when I heard in my dream, on the quarter-deck of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
flag ship, the Admiral thus addressed the carpenter,
with a certain meaning twinkle in his eye. "That
leaky old tub can never swim round Cape Horn,
Carpenter." "I think not, your Honour," discreetly
replied Mr. Chips. "Youngster," continued the
Admiral turning quickly to a little middy, "go to
Captain B. with my compliments, and tell him to call
an immediate survey on the Discovery Ship." The
little middy touched his cap respectfully, and off he
jumped with his message. "Mr. C.," cried the
Admiral to the other midshipman who stood by the
signal-locker, "signalize the propeller to light her
fires, and get up all steam." In thirty seconds four
bits of bunting flew out from the mizen royal-mast
head.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The last object that I saw in my vision was the
figure of a woman, walking the ramparts of an old
Spanish city on the Pacific coast of Central America.
Matronly, and dignified in her air and bearing, her
featured bore the impress of past anxiety, but across
them flitted at times the consciousness of approaching
joy. She gazed wistfully ever and anon seaward;
and my heart yearned to tell her all that I had so
lately seen. The herd of vulgar gold-hunters, who
thronged the battlements, respected her, for her
long-continued sorrows, her abiding faith, her matchless
perseverance. They pressed not on her steps.</p>

<p>I, too, who knew more than they did, how I longed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to see the meeting&mdash;but no, no, 'twere better that it
should be sacred.</p>

<p>I had not the choice; at this moment, forced upon
my unwilling ears, through the key-hole came a tiny
voice, "Please, Sir, mother says won't you get up;
the stage will be here in ten minutes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<h2>WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>An Eastern Apologue&mdash;From the French.</i></p>


<p>----I read her my manuscript; I had been abusing
woman I must confess. Not a single good word could
I say for the sex; and long did my companion and I
battle the point. Many truisms, much that was strictly
veritable had I brought forward, and she had been
obliged to yield to the justice of almost all my remarks,
though disclaiming against my slander at the same
time. Finally&mdash;"You intend to marry, yourself?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly," I replied; "to find a woman bold
enough to take me, after having convinced her that I
knew all the duplicity of the sex, will henceforward be
the dearest of my hopes."</p>

<p>"Is this resignation or fatuity?"</p>

<p>"That is my secret."</p>

<p>"Well, then," she said, "most learned doctor of conjugal
arts and sciences, permit me to relate to you a
little Eastern apologue, that I read long ago in a small
volume that was offered to us every year in the shape
of an almanac." I bowed my delighted attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
The pretty creature threw herself back in her <i>chaise
longue</i>, rested her little feet upon the fender, and fixed
her arch dark eyes upon me.</p>

<p>"At the commencement of the Empire," she began,
"the ladies brought into fashion a game which consisted
in accepting nothing from the person with whom one
agreed to play, without saying the word 'Iadeste.'
An affair of this kind lasted, as you may suppose, whole
weeks, and the height of cleverness was to surprise one
another into receiving a trifle without uttering the magic
word."</p>

<p>"Even a kiss?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I have twenty times gained 'Iadeste' in that
way," said she, laughing. "It was, I believe, about
this time, apropos of this game of which the origin is
either Arabian or Chinese, that my apologue obtained
the honours of print."</p>

<p>"But if I tell it to you," she interrupted, looking
doubtfully at me, and passing her taper finger slowly
across her lips, with a charmingly coquettish gesture,
"promise me to insert it at the end of your book!"</p>

<p>"Will you not be bestowing a treasure? I owe you
already so many obligations, I do not hesitate to add
this; therefore, I accept it at once." She smiled maliciously,
and went on in these words.</p>

<p>"A philosopher had compiled a very large collection
of all the tricks our sex can play; and so, to guard
himself against our wiles, he carried this constantly
about him. One day, in travelling, he found himself
near an Arabian encampment. A young woman, sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
under the shade of a palm-tree, got up suddenly, on the
approach of the stranger, and invited him so obligingly
to repose under her tent that he could not resist accepting.
The husband of this lady was then absent. The
philosopher had scarcely established himself upon the
soft carpets, when his graceful hostess presented him
with fresh dates and a vessel full of milk; he could not
help seeing the rare perfection of the hands which offered
the beverage and the fruit. But to recover from
the confusion into which the charms of the young Arabian
had thrown him, and whose snares he began to
dread, the wise man drew out his book and read! The
enchanting creature, piqued at this disdain, said to him
in the sweetest voice, 'That book must be very interesting,
since it seems to be the only thing you consider
worthy of notice. Would it be an indiscretion to ask
the name of the science of which it treats!' The philosopher
replied without raising his eyes,  'The subject
of this book is beyond the comprehension of woman.'
This refusal excited more and more the curiosity of
the young Arabian. She put forward the prettiest
little foot that ever left its transient trace upon the
fleeting sands of the desert. The sage began to waver;
his truant looks would wander toward those dainty feet
till his eyes, too powerfully tempted, finally mingled
the flame of their admiration with the fire that darted
from the ardent and black orbs of the young Asiatic.
Again, then, she asked in her soft low tones, 'what is
the book?' and the charmed philosopher replied, 'I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
am the author of this work. It contains a record of all
the tricks that woman ever invented!'</p>

<p>"'What! all&mdash;absolutely all?' inquired the daughter
of the desert.</p>

<p>"'Yes&mdash;all! And it is only in studying woman constantly,
that I have been able to overcome my fear of
them.'</p>

<p>"'Ah!' said the Arabian, dropping the long lashes
of her snowy eyelids; and then throwing suddenly upon
the pretended sage the full lustre of her Eastern eyes
she made him forget in one instant his valuable book
and its invaluable contents. Behold my philosopher
the most impassioned of men!</p>

<p>"Thinking that he perceived in the manner of his
young hostess a slight touch of coquetry, the stranger
hazarded an avowal of his adoration. How could he
have resisted? The sky was so blue, the sand shone in
the distance like a blade of gold; the wind brought
love upon its wings, and the wife of the absent Arab
seemed to reflect all the brilliancy with which she was
surrounded. Her bright eyes, too, became liquid; and
she seemed, by a slight movement of her graceful head,
to consent to listen to the honeyed words of the quondam
philosopher.</p>

<p>"The wise man was in a full tide of eloquence when
the distant gallop of a horse was heard rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>"'We are lost!' cried the alarmed Fatima; 'my
husband is coming. He is jealous as a tiger, and still
more fierce. In the name of the Prophet, and if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
love your life, hide yourself in this chest!' The frightened
author, seeing nothing else to do, rushed into the
chest; his hostess shut it down, locked it, and took the
key. She went to meet her spouse, and after several
caresses, which put him into the best of humour, 'I
must tell you,' said she, 'a very singular adventure.'</p>

<p>"'I listen, my gazelle,' said the Arabian, seating
himself upon a cushion and crossing big legs after the
Oriental fashion.</p>

<p>"'There came here to-day a kind of philosopher;
he pretended to have collected in a book all the treacheries
of which my sex is capable; and this false sage&mdash;spoke&mdash;to&mdash;me
of love!'</p>

<p>"'Well?'</p>

<p>"'I listened to him!' At these words the Arab
bounded like a lion, and drew his kangiar. The philosopher,
from the bottom of the chest, heard all, and
sent to the devil his book, woman, and all the men of
Arabia Petrea.</p>

<p>"'Fatima!' cried the husband, if you wish to live,
answer! 'Where is the traitor?'</p>

<p>"Horrified at the storm she had raised, Fatima threw
herself at the feet of her lord, and trembling under
the menacing steel of the poniard, she pointed out the
coffer, with a single look, as prompt as it was timid.
Then rising, ashamed, she drew the key from her girdle
and gave it to her jealous lord. But&mdash;as he turned
furiously from her, the malicious beauty burst into
a shout of laughter, and laying her white hand upon
his shoulder, 'Iadeste!' she exclaimed; 'at last, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
shall have my beautiful gold chain! Give it to me;
you have lost. Another time, Fazom, have a little better
memory!' The husband stupefied, let fall the key,
and presenting the golden chain, on his knees, offered
his dear Fatima to bring her all the jewels of all the
caravans that passed that year, if she would only give
up such cruel methods of gaining the 'Iadeste.' Then,
as he was an Arabian and did not like to lose his gold
chain, though it was to his wife, he remounted his steed
and went off, grumbling at his ease in the desert&mdash;for
he loved Fatima too much to show her his regrets.</p>

<p>"At last, the young woman released the philosopher
more dead than alive from his prison, and said to him,
gravely,</p>

<p>"'Mr. Philosopher, don't forgot to insert this trick
in your collection.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>And so you cannot coax yourself off to sleep? Why?
Were you beguiled by their exquisite flavour into rashly
smoking three or four of those potent Regalias, with
which your friend, the rich stock-broker, professes to
aid the digestion of his guests, after a lengthened sitting
at his luxurious table? Or did the rounded arm
and taper fingers of his fair wife, presiding over the
mysteries of the silver urn, tempt you to indulgence
in too frequent cups of Souchong? Perhaps you are
endeavouring, in spite of yourself, to solve some knotty
problem in politics, or love, or chess, or mathematics.
Perhaps you have a considerable bill to take up to-morrow,
with a very slim balance at your banker's.
Perhaps you have a heart-ache; perhaps a head-ache.
At any rate, your nerves and senses are painfully
strained; and you feel as though you would give the
world and all, for a lullaby that would serve its purpose.
My good Sir, compose your mind. If you can't
sleep and dream, as you desire&mdash;dream and sleep. Reverse,
I say, the common order. And do not sneer
at the suggestion, unless you prefer tossing about all
night in vain. The process is not only not impossible;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
it is not half so difficult as you might suppose, presuming&mdash;as
I have a right to presume, in regard to my

<p>Some persons recommend to the restless and wide-awake
the repetition of scraps from books, in prose or
verse, just as though every one had a plenteous store
of "elegant extracts" garnered up in his memory, and
as though authors specially aimed at being somniferous.
There are indeed not a few among them, who
unavoidably achieve this distinction; and the advice
might not really be bad, if you could con over&mdash;once
would be sufficient&mdash;Mr. A.'s last pamphlet on political
economy, or the Rev. Mr. B.'s last sermon. On
the whole however, inasmuch as your favourite passages&mdash;should
you know any of them by heart&mdash;may
be the very opposite of soothing in their tendencies,
this mode of wooing slumber can scarcely be pronounced
successful.</p>

<p>You must commence, I say, by dreaming, if you
would compel yourself gently to sleep; but before I
proceed to introduce to you my list of available prescriptions
in this line, I note one with which my readers
may possibly be familiar, having learned it in
their school-boy days. You will not now be told for
the first time, that a drowsy sensation may be induced
by musing upon&mdash;or dreaming of, which is the same
thing&mdash;a field of tall and ripe barley, swept by fresh
autumnal gales. The rise and fall of each bowed head,
with its feathery and graceful spikes, combines well
with the undulating motion of the whole and the varied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
play of light and shade. The idea is otherwise expressed
by the British Laureate in "The Poet's Song,"
one of his minor pieces; "and waves of shadow," says
he, "went over the wheat." Nevertheless it is clear
that he missed the proper application of the thought,
for, in place of lulling the beholder to forgetful repose,
the sight seems to have made him break out into a
song so loud that wild swans paused to listen in their
flight, larks fluttered down to earth, swallows gave up
hunting bees, snakes slipped under sprays, wild hawks
stared over sparrows stricken under their claws, and
the very nightingales were set a-thinking. Truly a
sad perversion this of a golden opportunity! But
your rhymsters were ever a crazy race. When they
deal with their fellows generally, we all know how
they botch poor human nature. What, then, can be
expected, when poets undertake to figure out one of
themselves? Still, let us improve the occasion. Barley-fields
or wheat-fields are well enough in their way;
only, if you conjure up this image, I would advise you
to season it with an abundance of red poppies intermingled
with the legitimate crop, and a very careful
attempt on your part to number these interlopers one
by one, preparatory, if so it please you, to flipping off
their heads. With due allowance, therefore, for its
lack of novelty, this dream may be admitted into our
collection.</p>

<p>And it may be proper to remark at the outset that,
though the dreams whereof I propose to treat are
sufficiently distinct in their kind, it is desirable, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
practical use of them, to run them one into another&mdash;to
fuse them unconsciously as it were, without being
over-nice as to the point at which one ends and another
begins. It is not requisite, however, for this reason,
that they should all be packed into one paragraph,
like a daily paper's report of one of Mr. Morrill's
speeches on the Tariff, or a Secretary of the Treasury's
Report. You shall have each dainty conceit served
up in its own dish, so that, furthermore by the way,
you can take them in such order as suits your own
good pleasure. This view of the matter relieves me
also from the necessity of formal arrangement. It is
altogether unimportant which fancy comes uppermost.
The main thing is to shut off all thought concerning
the actualities of life, eschewing reference to your
loves, your hates, your wrestlings with circumstance,
your mental cares, your bodily ailments. I repeat it:
you must dream, if you would sleep. Counting the
breezy barley-field above mentioned as one, I believe
I can supply you with a dozen subjects.</p>

<p>Your physical eye is closed, of course&mdash;your mind's
eye being, on that account, all the more keenly alive
to impression, and the better able to compass an unembarrassed
range. Set it, then, upon a spiral stairway
endless so far as I can imagine it, though you may perchance
by looking earnestly upward discover whereto
it leads, or by peering intently downward find out its
base. But did I say a stairway? That was not what
I meant; and dreamers, of all men, are at liberty to
change or modify their views. I should have said an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
inclined plane. Let it be steep, smooth, slippery, broad
enough to admit the passage of several figures simultaneously,
and guarded by bannisters on either side.
When, fatigued with the vain attempt to satisfy your
doubts as to the safety of this strange structure, your
curiosity craves enlightenment as to its uses, I pray
you to observe how I would have it peopled. Sliding
tumultuously adown the balustrades, lo and behold an
innumerable throng of Cherubs in unbroken succession,
coming whence and going whither you know not, but
each the counterpart of his predecessors, and each flapping
his little wings to maintain his balance, rendered
precarious as it is by his inability to sit a-straddle. As
for the inclined plane itself thus fantastically flanked,
you soon perceive that it is the <i>via sacra</i> of many
an Ethardo, whom you have known in the flesh or in
the spirit&mdash;Ethardo, the marvellous gymnast, who
mounted and descended steep slopes at the Sydenham
Crystal Palace, by trundling inflated balls beneath
his feet.  Up and down, down and up, some painfully
and some skilfully pediculating, your Ethardi pass
and repass each other, disorderly yet in order. Name
them and salute them as they go by. You have probably
more acquaintances among them than I; but I
recognise Robinson Crusoe and Count Bismarck, Tarquinius
Priscus and Horace Greeley, John Ruskin
and Lucrezia Borgia, Mrs. Fry and Edgar Poe, Mr.
Gladstone and Dion Boucicault, John Bright and Mrs.
Grundy, Ben. Wade and Victor Hugo, Pio Nono and
the Great Mogul. Note, too, the various material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
moulded into circular form, and blown up by way of
ambulant footstool; now it is a crown, now a crozier,
now a bag of gold, now a wind-bag, now a woman's
heart, now a man's fame done up in a newspaper and
properly puffed. Ring the changes upon these Ethardi
and the motive power that each applies, O my wakeful
friend; and at least you may lose sight of your own
individuality. Or, take a slide down the banisters
with the young Cherubs, and perchance you may touch
bottom&mdash;in Lethe.</p>

<p>Not so? Let us proceed. There's a man at our
Club, whose reputation is so solidly built up, though
on an ethereal basis, that I never knew any one presume
to question it. He is an absolute master of
one accomplishment; unrivalled, and&mdash;to the best of
my belief, though I can't vouch for the fact&mdash;unenvied.
Admiring spectators gather round him and applaud;
but, if he have ambitious imitators, they rehearse in
secret. So far, he does well&mdash;ay, with consummate
tact and unfailing certainty&mdash;what few men can do
at all, unless once in a while at dreary intervals, and
then by accident. Not to keep you in suspense,
which is antagonistic to repose and slumber, this young
paragon contrives to throw off his cigar-smoke from
his lips, at will, in an unerring series of the most lovely
rings or wreaths, which, as they float and rise in
tremulous succession, strangely fascinate the looker-on.
It may be that this feat is not much of an achievement,
morally or physically or intellectually considered.
It may be also that the Club does not do itself much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
honour, in setting so high a value on this performance.
But what will you? In the palmy days of Greece, a
man acquired a certain celebrity by his precision and
address in throwing peas through a needle's eye&mdash;the
peas being, I presume, much smaller or the needles
much larger, than any with which we sow or make
soup in these degenerate days. Still, so highly do I
appreciate perseverance in the acquirement of any
difficult art, that I purpose doing much more for my
proficient in smoke, than was done for his man of peas
by Philip of Macedon. That bushel of ammunition
was a scurvy reward. I confer immortality, by thus
registering a fact and hinting a name. And I do
this from a sense of gratitude, wherein I trust that
you will participate, so soon as you perceive the connection
that may surely be traced, between the smoke
thus artistically and gracefully jetted into air, and the
drowsiness by which you would fain be possessed.
Do but imagine a score of your acquaintances round
a table, each an adept in this way, and each filling the
atmosphere with coronet after coronet of vapour thrown
up from meerschaum or cheroot. Whose are the
most frequent, whose the most perfect, whose retain
their form the longest? Watch the little circlets as
they wave and tremble; and award the palm of merit
fairly. Nay, even if you tell me that you are innocent
of the weed and nauseated by its odour, none
the less shall this fantasy be available. I saw once a
ship-of-war firing a salute; and lo, from one of the guns
went up to the pure sky, in magnified proportions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
just such a wreath as those I have described, as delicate
yet as clearly defined, and touched withal with a
suspicion of prismatic colours as it caught the rays of
the sun. An enthusiastic painter might have deemed
it an invisible Fairy's aureole; a sentimental milliner
would have set it down as the flounce of her unseen
robe. Whether the gunner of this occasion had taken
a lesson from my friend at the Club, I cannot pretend
to decide; I only assure you that I witnessed the
phenomenon. You have, therefore, but to multiply
as well as magnify. Think of a squadron, a fleet, all
the navies of the world, sailing slowly and majestically
in unending circuit, as the custom is when they
bombard some hapless fort. The saluting is continuous;
the movement never ceases; but the big cannon
are noiseless now and harmless. Space is joyous with
the innumerable wreaths of bluish vapour; but the
red slaughter and the accursed tumult of the sea-fight
are not heard or seen. Ponder long and lazily, I
counsel you, over the evolutions of the ships and the
convolutions of the smoke. Those may lure you, possibly,
into the Waters of Oblivion; these may spirit
you away to the land of the Lotos-Eaters.</p>

<p>Another dream invites you; but it must be sketched
with more reticence, and this for two reasons. In
the first place, the subject has become identified with
that portion of theatrical entertainments usually found
to be the least soporific. In the second place, if your
imagination were encouraged to free range hereupon,
you might be foolish enough to connect its poetic mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>tion
and its charm with certain souvenirs of a certain
fair friend of yours, whom it were wiser to forget if
you desire to profit by this Mandragorean system.
Briefly, then, I commend a Ballet, as not altogether unworthy
of trial&mdash;but not, be it observed, that thing of gas
lamps, and pink tights, and leers, and <i>poses plastiques</i>,
over which young America goes into raptures. By
no means. Picture to yourself a smooth sward beneath
clustered pines, a tender moonlight, and Nymphs&mdash;not
semi-nude as is the fashion of our day, neither affecting
the contortions of the gymnast as in our modern
caricature of dancing&mdash;but robed in swansdown, with
nodding plumes and tasseled fuschias pendent, tripping
it, if you will, on "light fantastic toe," yet through
stately and solemn measures. You remember Giulio
Romano's dance of Apollo and the Muses in the Pitti
at Florence? Take that for your model; then place
the figures to your liking. Nor forget to add an orchestra
of Æolian harps. Let them hang among the
pine-branches, and sigh forth Weber's Last Waltz, just
to set the groups in motion. Then fail not in your
breathings, O soft night-wind; foot it daintily, ye wildwood
Nymphs&mdash;so may sleep steal gently upon the
restless one, while yet his ear and eye are unsated!</p>

<p>Another dream: blue water again, though, this time,
with a golden beach. It is calm; but the surf rolls
in languidly, with low murmurous sound, as it will
roll, be the sea's surface never so smooth, beyond the
involuntary breakers. What graceful bends and curves
are marked, for an instant, with frothy pencil, upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
shining sands! How they sparkle with evanescent
light! How soon the tiny bubbles disappear! But
you have watched all this, many and many a time;
and stale indeed hereon were description and moralizing!
Why, then, this present allusion? What is
there in it, tending to lull the acuter sensibilities?
What offers it of gently-soothing exercise to the overwrought
and throbbing brain? This is the reply.
Popular belief gives to every ninth or tenth wave,
tumbling in upon the shore, supremacy over its fellows.
It swells up into fuller volume. It sweeps
landward with a more majestic force. This is the
story; but I would have you test its correctness. Is
it the ninth, or the tenth? So, lie down yonder upon
the mass of dry sea-weed piled against the rocks, and
count patiently a dozen, a score, a hundred, a thousand
waves as they come in. You shall tell me, to-morrow
morning, whether the ninth have it, or the
tenth&mdash;whether there be any regularity at all.</p>

<p>Again: if we do not, like the Roman Augurs, watch
and interpret the flight of birds as of good or evil
omen, some of them&mdash;I mean some of the birds, not
of the Augurs&mdash;may help us to become, for a while,
independent of fate and fortune. Did you ever, for
instance, sit at a window on a summer's evening, and
take note how a flight of swallows skims the air?
They are not very numerous, perhaps; but as they
dart to and fro, and cross and recross before you, their
number appears indefinite, and the zigzag peculiarity
of their movements can only be verified by the closest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
possible scrutiny. I have satisfied myself that the
motion is regular, and that it describes an elongated
figure of 8, traced as I am sure you have often traced
it upon ice with the outer edge of your skates. Now,
though I tell you this on the faith of my own personal
observation, you are not bound to accept my word
for it. Dream therefore that, while you are blending
two ovals into one figure upon the frozen pond, swallows
overhead are keeping time to your gyrations.
The winter sport and the summer bird may be made
to harmonize, as it is only in a dream; and close
watching will enable you hereafter to support or disavow
my theory.</p>

<p>Again: return, if you please, from air to water, for
you have by no means exhausted the resources of this
latter element, in the way of material for dreams.
Are you an angler? Did you never drowse and doze
over your rod, when "sitting in a pleasant shade," on
a sultry afternoon, not a nibble disturbed the equanimity
of your float? The mere thought were suggestive
of a nap&mdash;suggestive, that is, to the indolently disposed,
with whom however you may not be classed,
seeing that your mind is in a state of unwholesome
excitement, the which it is my business to allay. And
so, I pray you, look deeper into this matter; pry down
into the blue transparent depths, and mark the fish
that swarm about your hook. Is it paste thereon, or
a wriggling worm? Never mind; the bait is singularly
attractive. To say nothing of the float gently bobbing
ever and anon, and of the tell-tale ripples rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to the surface, you can see with your own eyes how
victims dally with temptation; how they course to
and fro, and round and round; how one eyes the bait,
and another smells it, and another mumbles it; how
one swims away, and presently returns, and with him
his mate in size and colour. Are they over-fed or
over-cautious, that they thus play round, but will
not gorge? Does one egg on his brother to try the
suspicious morsel, hoping himself to profit by his
brother's experience? Is there so much resemblance
to human foibles discernible down there, among these
poor little inhabitants of the waters under the Earth?
The question is worth studying out&mdash;especially by a
sleepless man, who, while contemplating the forms,
the motions, the manners, and the minds of fish, may
unconsciously swallow the bait that is thus dropped
before him.</p>

<p>It was my intention to devote a long and distinct
paragraph to each of four other subjects, that appear
to me no less adapted for the consideration of waking
dreamers. These are, respectively, Ghosts, Labyrinths,
Regattas, and the Eleven Thousand Virgins
of Cologne. But it is well to leave something to the
reader's perspicacity and inventive powers. Indeed,
why should he not fancy&mdash;dream is the more appropriate
term&mdash;that he himself has undertaken to complete
these special paragraphs? Let his imaginary
pen glide, swift and effortless, over his imaginary
foolscap. Ten to one, he will fill in and elaborate my
outlines, far better than I could work them out my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>self.
For instance, I do but mention Ghosts; he
might summon to his presence, and bid troop before
him, hosts upon hosts of his friends or relatives, or
of his chosen heroes and heroines in romance and
history. He might clothe them in white or in grey;
he might attire them in their ordinary habiliments;
in short, he might parade them according to his own
taste, without reference to mine, which whould be a
clear point in his favour. Accidentally, I might call
up some spirit that had vexed and thwarted him
through life, for no man whose experience is worth
remembering hath not had his enemies, hidden or
revealed, and very few are the men, fewer the women,
who have never disposed of a rival. My reader of
the moment, invested with my functions, will of course
evoke none but his familiars, the well-bred and well-behaved.
Let me be grateful accordingly that, by
transferring the responsibility to him, I escape the
chance of bringing forward, innocently and inopportunely,
some social Banquo. And so I pass on, with
one single word of caution to my substitute in completing
this paragraph: let him not convert his pen
into a Pre-Raphaelitish paint-brush. Airy beings
must be rather hinted than described. The realism
of anatomical plates, applied to them, would spoil the
reader's dream <i>in toto</i>, and wake him up perhaps more
hopelessly than ever.&mdash;As to Labyrinths, the course
is obvious. Take a dozen of these quaint contrivances,
and place them side by side, as Paulsen or Paul Morphy
may place the sundry chess-boards whereat he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to play, simultaneously and blindfolded, an equivalent
number of games. Pop, over the hedges and into the
very core of each one, any personage against whom
you have a grudge, or any one of the Ghosts just convened
that may have been troublesome; and then
challenge the incarcerated individuals to find their
way out of limbo, by the gravelled pathways. Should
one of the whole number emerge, through extraordinary
good luck, quietly tip him back again over the
hedge, or defy him to retrace his steps and regain the
centre. You may enlarge this suggestion, I think,
into a paragraph reasonably long.&mdash;The same with
Regattas. I am almost sorry that I gave up to you
so felicitous a topic; for all ages and all waters may
be laid under contribution. From Noah's Ark shall
float the commodore's broad pendant. The ocean
shall be covered, so far as eye can range, with countless
craft of every build and rig. And all shall glide
about in quiet, inasmuch as oars shall be muffled,
and steamers, having learned to consume their own
smoke, shall be taught equally to swallow their hideous
noises. The marshalling of the competitors and
the order of the racing are left to your discretion;
but there need be no lack of interest. Caiques from
Stamboul and gondolas from Venice shall be frequent;
and pirogues from the Malayan peninsula shall over-haul
the three trim yacht-schooners that raced across
the Atlantic from New-York. Here Cleopatra's
barge shall be matched against an Esquimaux kayak;
there a catamaran from Coringa shall bump the Yale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
College eight. If you cannot make something out of
all this picturesque confusion, and if you cannot contrive
to lose therein both yourself and the reader of
your paragraph, the fault will be yours, not mine.&mdash;There
remain the Eleven Thousand Virgins of Cologne.
What are you to do with them? Simply this.
Endow each one of them with personal attributes;
let each have form and features, distinct from the
others of her sisterhood. Is the task difficult? So
much the better. After a cool thousand or so of these
individual portraitures, you may begin to fumble in
vain for separate identities. In fact, who knows
whether you may not be compelled to take refuge
hopelessly in sleep, the very mark at which both of
us are aiming?</p>

<p>And now, the foregoing long and subdivided paragraph
being brought at last to an end, it were disingenuous
to shirk an admission, that the "who's who"
is not so plainly discernible therein as it might be.
You and I, and the reader and the writer, and the
giver and recipient of advice, will be accused by the
critic of being somewhat queerly mixed up. What,
then? Are not vagueness and uncertainty of style
specially appropriate to the circumstances? Who
would thank us for precision? No, no; carry clearness,
if you like, into your mathematical definitions;
but leave us our mistiness when we treat of the mysterious.
Nor, on the whole, am I otherwise than
content with my suggested assumption of temporary
and imaginary authorship, as one of the methods for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
quieting a fevered brain. How pleasant to dream
that rival Publishers are contending for your manuscript
poems; that rival Managers are waylaying you
for a sight of your unwritten comedy! Besides, by
adding authorship to the list that closed with the
damsels of Cologne, the number is brought up to
eleven, so that, when I wind up with my trump card,
the promised dozen of dreams will be complete, and I
shall be enabled to dispense with the "waves of
shadow" on the wheat-field, which I acknowledged
were not my original conception.</p>

<p>But am I too late in bringing forward my last and
happiest idea?&mdash;though for that matter, when the tale
of Mazeppa was concluded, "the King had been an
hour asleep," and yet Mazeppa's story was told out
ne'ertheless. For your immediate purpose therefore,
or for use on your next sleepless night, I entrust you
with the crowning opiate. Recollect that you are
dreaming; and dream that all your intimates and
relatives, all of whom you have ever heard or read
with interest, men and women and children, people
of every age and clime&mdash;imagine them, I say, all seated
before you at a round table. How any table is to
accommodate so vast a multitude, is their affair, and
yours; the dreamer is never baulked by technical impediments.
Have your eye upon them all at once&mdash;another
little difficulty, to be overcome only by mortals
in the incipient stage of somnolency. Or, if
your mind's eye obstinately refuses to enlarge its
orbit in this direction, so as to embrace such a vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and heterogeneous assemblage, gather, I beseech you,
into one focus any such crowd as you habitually see.
The Sunday audience of the Reverend Henry Ward
Beecher will answer the purpose; or you may fancy
yourself at one of the old Tammany Hall Meetings; or
at the Opera, on a fashionable night; or in the Senate
at Washington during the impeachment of Mr. Johnson.
It matters not when and where; but the proceedings
strike you as insufferably dull, and you give
vent to your feelings in a yawn that may neither be suppressed
nor concealed. Suddenly, moved by the same
impulse and unable also to control or hide its effect, the
jaw of every soul present is dropped to the lowermost,
and all mouths are open in a universal yawn. It is
not catching; it is caught. Beecher gapes, and the
elect are gaping round him. Isaiah Rynders the
same, and the same with his "unterrified" hearers.
Parepa-Rosa stands open-mouthed in dumb show
of singing, while humming-birds perched on chignons
vibrate, as they vainly try to resist the irresistible.
Gape the Republicans, and gape the Democrats, in
response to the gaping Butler on his legs. There is,
in Shakespeare's words&mdash;though his ignorant editors
have transformed it into a "gap"&mdash;there is, I say, "a
gape in Nature." Will you alone hold out: I can't
believe it. You have yawned in concert, I am morally
certain. Indeed, if, as these long-drawn prescriptions
come to an end, you be not far on the road
to forgetfulness, I can give you but one parting counsel.
Nothing else can serve and save you&mdash;you must
incontinently take morphine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="DOCTOR_PABLOS_PREDICTION" id="DOCTOR_PABLOS_PREDICTION"></a>DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="center">Doctor Pablo went back a lonely man, to his old mother, in France,
after having passed twenty years in the Philippines.&mdash;<br />
<i>English magazine.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>He did so. We can vouch thus much for the correctness
of <i>Household Words</i> of the 6th inst., whence
the above-named quotation is copied. And as the subject
of it is a remarkable personage, and this unexpected
meeting with him in print has revived in us not a few
pleasant recollections, we will take the liberty of informing
our readers how we came to have personal knowledge
of Don Pablo&mdash;for this, and not Doctor Pablo,
was his cognomen, at least amongst his friends.</p>

<p>Embarking at Bombay, many a long year since,
in the East India Company's steamer <i>Atalanta</i>, for
passage up the Red Sea, we soon fell into acquaintance
with a party of foreigners, partially isolated as they
were from the crowd of Anglo-Indians&mdash;men, women,
and children&mdash;returning by the over-land route to their
native country. They (the foreigners) were five in
number, two Frenchmen, two Dutchmen, and a Spaniard.
Of the three last-mentioned we have small recollection.
Of the Frenchmen, one was Don Pablo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The other, who headed the whole party, was Monsieur
Adolphe Barrot, a brother of Odilon and Ferdinand
Barrot, whose names are familiar to those conversant
with recent French history. He was at the time bound
to Paris, on leave, from his post of Consul-General at
Manilla. At an early period of his career he had been
attached to the French Legation at Washington, or at
least had travelled through this country. Subsequently,
when Consul at Carthagena, he distinguished himself
by his resolute and humane interposition on occasion
of a certain revolutionary outbreak. After his
return from the East, he served as French Minister to
Naples and to Lisbon, and now, we believe, holds the
same appointment at Brussels. Between this man of
cultivated mind, polished manners, and companionable
qualities, and Don Pablo, whose exterior smacked but
little of intercourse with "the world," there was evidently
a bond of no common sort. Blunt, earnest,
truthful, with quick perceptions and impulses of the
kindest nature, there was something very fresh and irresistibly
attractive in the character of Don Pablo.
We did not wonder at the intimacy. Opposites are
drawn together. In friendly and social intercourse the
time sped away.</p>

<p>At that period, the steamers bound from Bombay to
Suez touched at Cosseir, a port two days' sail South of
Suez, and about 150 miles East of Thebes on the Nile.
The object was to land passengers who cared to cross
the intervening Desert, as the quickest mode of gaining
Upper Egypt. To Cosseir we were ourselves destined;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
our new friends being on their way direct to France,
<i>viâ</i> Suez, Cairo, and the Mediterranean, and having
made none of the ordinary provision for the less-frequented
route. But we plied them strongly with argument
and entreaty, to divert them from their intended
limited course; not forgetting the threat of ridicule
in a Parisian drawing-room, where a man who had
missed such a chance would never be able to hold up
his head. Finally, they consented. After a voyage
of sixteen days, the coaling process at Aden included,
three groups of travellers landed at Cosseir. We had
dealings with two of them.</p>

<p>For although we had persuaded Mr. Barrot, Don
Pablo and their associates, to take our route, we could
not precisely undertake to accompany them. We were
to travel over the same ground, but not together; for
we had engaged, ere we left Bombay, to join fortunes
with a small party of veterans and valetudinarians who
had made elaborate preparations for the journey, and
were not sorry to have the aid of one who did not belong
to either class, but who was perhaps for that very
reason more competent than they themselves to take
charge of their caravan. And then there was a lady,
and a lady's maid, and a valet, and the thousand and
one encumbrances that are incidental to such appendages.
What scenes we had with the camel-drivers!
What tons of baggage to be loaded! what irritations!
what drollery! what delay! Landing early in the
morning, the preparations for a start occupied us till
a late hour in the afternoon; nor had we ever a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
laboursome time of it. Lightly cumbered, and with
only a twentieth part of the fuss, Don Pablo and the
others had preceded us; but as the same camping-places
in this five days' journey are generally frequented,
we hoped to see them from time to time. Fortune
kindly ordained that we should join them permanently.</p>

<p>It was on a Saturday afternoon that we started from
Cosseir, with a train "too numerous to mention."
Night had fallen, ere we pitched our tents&mdash;the writer
sharing that of Sir C. M. At day-light on the following
morning, we strolled off to the French encampment;
were again pressed to join its occupants; were
again compelled reluctantly to refuse. Away they
went. We returned to our own quarters, where to our
horror, in place of hearing "boot and saddle" sounded,
the edict was issued from my lady's tent, that there
was to be no marching that day. Bah! how provoking!
we could not ask for an honourable discharge; but
how we longed to desert! Matters fell out, however,
more pleasantly then we had a right to expect. Breakfast
was served, with the elaborateness of a <i>fête champêtre</i>,
at eleven o'clock; and as the hostess gracefully
poured out the coffee, the talk turned upon those who
had sped onward. Presently, by a lucky chance, it
occured to her, or to the nominal head of the party,
that dawdling away a Sunday on a barren speck of
Mahommedan sand was not in itself the essential duty
of a plain Christian, nor specially agreeable to a man
whose thoughts were keenly set upon the marvels of
Luxor and Karnac. In short, it was mildly suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to us that, as the organization and first move of the
caravan&mdash;the real and only difficulties&mdash;were accomplished,
there would be nothing ungallant in leaving
the party to its more orthodox or more leisurely progress.
Our coyness may be imagined; but we consented
at length to take this view of the matter, and at noon
called up our camels. Soon were our trunks and
slender stock of kettles and sauce-pans slung upon one;
ourselves astride of a second; and on a third, the Arab
driver, with whom there was no communicating but by
signs. A twelve hours' ride brought us at midnight
to the tent of our friends&mdash;they having luckily found
one available at Cosseir. We raised the canvas from
the pegs, and saluted Don Pablo with a "Here I am!"
Many years have elapsed since that night, but we can
fancy now that we hear his genial rejoinder, "I knew
you'd come!" In less time than it takes to tell it, we
had edged in our bedding upon the sand, and were
one of the Seven&mdash;no, six&mdash;Sleepers.</p>

<p>Had not a <i>Howadji</i> of this Western hemisphere made
the Desert and the Nile so peculiarly his own, that it
is presumption for a common pen to follow in his track,
we might be tempted still further to ransack our memory
for pleasant recollections of Don Pablo. Let it
suffice to say, that with these pleasant companions we
roughed it across the camel-track, in a style of discomfort
and good humour rarely surpassed; explored the
wonders of Thebes and the Tombs of the Kings; floated
down to Cairo; clambered the Great Pyramid; smoked
pipes with Pashas; and finally embarked at Alexandria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
on the blue waters of the Mediterranean. The farewell
was said at Syra, one of the islands of the Ægean.
The "five we supped with yesternight" were bound to
Malta and Marseilles&mdash;we to Athens and Constantinople.
As we shook hands at parting with Don Pablo,
he quietly remarked, with that cheerful gravity that
so well became him, and in allusion to a young lady
who had been our three days' acquaintance on board
the steamer&mdash;"<i>Adieu, mon cher; vous épouserez Mademoiselle.</i>"</p>

<p>We never saw Don Pablo, but once afterwards.
Several months had elapsed. His prophecy had been
fulfilled. The lady in question was on our arm, as in
sauntering under the arcades of the Palais Royale
in Paris, we met our old associate. There was a
hearty greeting; but when we reminded him of his prediction
and formally introduced him, we remember that
he cut the colloquy abruptly short (as it then seemed
to us), and turned away with an expression of face for
which we were at a loss to account, being ignorant of
all the details of his history. Did the memory of the
Peninsula of Iala-Iala, and of the loving wife whom
he had buried there, fall too suddenly and too sadly
upon his sensitive and affectionate spirit?&mdash;We cannot
say; but this was the beginning and the ending of our
knowledge of Doctor Pablo, until we unexpectedly met
him in print.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.</h2>


<p>It is not very much of a walk from the Glen House
up the Eastern face of Mount Washington&mdash;less than
three hours at a leisurely pace will accomplish it; and
on a fine day it would be next to impossible to lose
one's-self, if alone. Half the distance or thereabouts,
your track lies through a wood, acceptable enough as
offering shelter from a July sun, but curtailing your
views annoyingly. However, all things end; and if
your range of sight be somewhat "cabined, cribbed,
confined," at the start, you have no cause for complaint
on that score after once emerging from covert,
for the rocks, bleak, bare, and irregular, that are scattered
all around, though large enough to compel a
careful picking of the way between them by no means
limit the vision. But the approach has been a hundred
times described, and I will only say of it, at the
risk of repetition, that he who comes up from the Glen
House, and fails to turn his eye continually over his
right shoulder, to dwell lovingly upon the near and
noble outlines of Mounts Jefferson, Adams, and Madison,
has no appreciation of this sort of scenery.</p>

<p>The morning had been superlatively fine, and troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of mounted dames and damsels and cavaliers made the
various pathways lively with their glee. But caprice
is the rule of these high regions; and when I was
within ten minutes of the summit, clouds of misty
vapour came suddenly scudding up, whence I knew
not, but shutting out a peep here and a vista there, as
they caracolled in fantastic evolutions. Presently, to
these kaleidoscopic effects succeeded a slight hailstorm&mdash;it
was rain visibly beneath us, attended with thunder
and lightning&mdash;but anon all was comparatively clear
again, and from the congregated spectators went up
many a genuine burst of enthusiastic admiration, as
point after point opened out or was shut in by the
scud.</p>

<p>The two rough stone buildings upon the small plateau
that crowns the mountain, built for the accommodation
of travellers, are called respectively the
"Summit" and the "Tip-top" House. Once rivals,
they now form a single establishment&mdash;one being used
as a restaurant, the other as a dormitory. On this
particular day, nearly a hundred persons must have
refreshed themselves in the former&mdash;a dozen or fifteen
in the latter; and I must own, it was not without a
sense of relief that I saw the last of the descending
parties set forth about 2 P. M., being myself of the
select few about to take the chance of sunset and sunrise.</p>

<p>For the afternoon, then&mdash;for the interval of time
was to be occupied&mdash;a guide was summoned, to show
half-a-dozen of us the wonders of Tuckerman's Ravine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
a <i>cul-de-sac</i> between two great buttresses of Mount
Washington, that prop it up towards the South and
West. The sides of this ravine are very precipitous
the head of it being formed of layers of rock, at an
angle of about ninety-five degrees, over which a cascade
precipitates itself, fed by the springs and melted
snows above. In the bed of this hollow, to which the
descent is sufficiently sharp to gratify the keenest
amateur pedestrian, the accumulated snow of the winter,
blown over from the impending heights, lies packed
in such enormous masses that it seldom entirely
disappears until the latter part of August. At the
period of my visit, on Friday, the 29th of July, a huge
portion thereof remained, and the famous "Snow-Arch"
was not only visible but practicable. This natural
curiosity is a cave channelled out from the vast
snow bank as a passage for the descending waters, the
roof of which, gradually melting away, leaves height
and space for walking along this gallery as it were in
the very bed of the torrent. You enter perforce, be
it observed, where the stream emerges. The length
was certainly not less than two hundred feet, the
breadth of the tunnel perhaps forty or fifty. Of the
thickness of the roof I cannot speak, not having
essayed it; but the little knot of adventurers trusted
that it would not cave-in whilst they were groping
their difficult way, one after the other, wet-footed and
in semi-obscurity, up-stream, from end to end of the
arched way. The object of the exploration it would
be difficult to define. It certainly was not scientific;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
it offered no rare beauties; it might have been very
well imagined, without the trouble and subsequent
risk&mdash;but it was an adventure, and it had its charm.
Day-light appeared as we neared the waterfall&mdash;luckily
not very full&mdash;which, as I have already said,
comes down the head of the ravine and is the origin
of the "Arch" itself. What next? The snow had
separated bodily from the face of the rocks to the
width of two or three feet, as you see ice fields in a
thaw detach themselves from the land whereto they
have been joined. We could therefore emerge, and
clamber up the abrupt face of the rocks, though the
first start was not inviting, inasmuch as we had to
hoist ourselves up by unequal pressure upon soft
snow on one side and hard rock on the other. The
alternative was a return. This would have been inglorious;
up we went. It was a rough business.
The guide had been over the ground once before, this
season&mdash;so he said, at least&mdash;but he "harked back"
occasionally, as though not quite certain of his way.
It seemed impossible to diverge either to the right
or left, and so gain the comparatively easier slope.
We were doomed to mount, in the hope of finding
successive steps, inasmuch as a retracing of those
taken was not for a moment to be thought of; descent
in such cases is always far more dangerous and troublesome.
It was fortunate that in crossing twice or
thrice the waterfall itself, we were not pumped on to
any serious extent. I was moistened only, being garnished
with a Macintosh; and I have only two scars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
now left on my shins, the result of scraping too close
an acquaintance with sundry rocks. The whole affair
lasted between three and four hours. I cannot recommend
it, save to very enthusiastic mountaineers,
or to <i>ci-devant jeunes hommes</i> anxious to test the
effects of Time upon their powers of walking and of
endurance.</p>

<p>Regaining the hurricane-deck of the Tip-top House&mdash;for
the roof is the principal promenade, and often times
assuredly deserves the name I give it, how
gratefully, as the sun went down, stole the sense of
ineffable grandeur over the somewhat wearied frame!
It was a superb evening; and though it would not
suit me to cull a leaf from the Guide-book, and tell
all that is therein narrated, I must mention one particular
wherein this locality is notable, if not quite
unique. I think I remember something of the kind,
but not so marked, at sunrise as seen from the
summit of Etna; but not thus, on the Righi and
Faulhorn in Switzerland, on the Pic du Midi de Bigorre
in the Pyrenees, or on other peaks that I have
climbed in the days of long ago, to salute the coming
or speed the parting day. The nearest approach to
it that I have seen, was at the Great Pyramid of
Ghizeh. I allude to the wonderful distinctness and
regularity with which the shadow of the great cone
itself is traced, at sunset, striding over heights and
lowlands, mound and lake&mdash;all the intervening surface,
in fact, between the spectator and the far distant
horizon&mdash;until it contracts almost to a point where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
earth and sky merge into one. The sharpness of
these converging parallel lines of shadow in that
luminous atmosphere absolutely astounded me. They
were as crisp, as clearly defined, as those that you
may see in antique pictures of Jacob's Dream, leading
ladder-wise from Heaven to the head of the slumbering
Patriarch. Sunrise, next morning&mdash;for I was
again favoured with clear weather and only sufficient
frost to render the roof of the restaurant slightly
slippery&mdash;sunrise, I say, reserved all this. The
narrow lines, now on the Western horizon, broadened
out and came upwards and forwards, as in the evening
they had elongated and gone down. It was in
truth a rare spectacle, not to be forgotten, and individualizes
this natural observatory.</p>

<p>As for the view itself, it has been described <i>ad nauseam</i>,
and I have only a few words to say about it.
It happened, as it often does happen, that I fell in
with an untravelled admirer of the prospect spread
out before us, not charmed however with it more than
I was myself. But he would persist in drawing from
me an answer to the common question&mdash;"how does
this compare with some of the famous points of view
in the Swiss Alps?" Such tests I hold to be absurd,
thanking my stars that I can unreservedly enjoy all fair
things that are good of their kind. And so I told the
inquirer this simple fact. If, in a mountainous country,
varied, broken, studded with lakes, and rife with
all the elements of the picturesque, you ascend some
such superior elevation as this, you have, <i>looking down</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span><i>wards</i>,
a striking panoramic scene, like this in its general
features&mdash;more striking perhaps than beautiful,
though this is all matter of taste. The difference lies
herein. Here, you plunge your look downward, or
sweep it over surrounding objects&mdash;and that's the end
of it. In those other Alps, you add to the four or
five or six thousand feet, below you, as much above&mdash;and
it is that <i>upward</i> glance which takes in the marvels
of glacier and snow-field and inaccessible peaks. My
new acquaintance asked for no more comparisons, but
let me enjoy myself in my own quiet way.</p>

<p>The walk down Mount Washington to Crawford's
at the Great Notch, as I believe it is called, is rather
a long affair. It must be ten miles, and parts of it
are of the roughest. It took me four hours, in company
with two intelligent and companionable young
students of Harvard College, travelling (in the true
way) a-foot, with knapsacks on their backs. But we
hurried it too much, especially as the ridge over and
along Mount Pleasant, and some of its fellows bearing
Presidential names, abound in points of view
worth dwelling on. Moreover I was foot-galled; and
this reminds me that, inasmuch as I cannot to-day
conclude my rambling reminiscences, I may as well
wind up with a touch of information and of advice.
The one is intended for the benefit of pedestrians who
make excursions of this sort; the other for stay-at-homes
in flat countries, who have no definite notion
whatever of the ups and downs of hilly regions.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, you who walk are painfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
aware that a sore foot is almost a calamity, if it befall
you whilst <i>en route</i>. Remedy there is none; be thankful
that there is an infallible preventive, of whose unfailing
excellence I can speak with unreserved commendation.
On its simple merits I once averaged in
Switzerland twenty-five miles a day, for thirty successive
days; and this without gall or blister. Fool that
I was, to neglect it, two or three weeks ago. Nothing
is easier. Ere you start in the morning, soap or grease
the naked foot thoroughly, and then draw the stocking
over it. Wash off, with a dash of brandy in the
water, on finishing your day's work. The play of the
foot is the preservative against abrasion&mdash;a certain
one, I assure you.</p>

<p>In the second place, if&mdash;passing your life amid prairies
or savannahs&mdash;you are sometimes puzzled to
comprehend allusions to buttresses, shoulders, ridges,
peaks, cones, ravines, and the various terms in use
among enthusiastic mountaineers, I think I can put
you on a very simple explanatory track. Next time
you lie in bed, with a few spare moments for reflection
upon this grave topic, just turn on to your back and
elevate one knee or both knees. The coverlid or sheet
will immediately assume&mdash;I am serious in saying&mdash;a
curiously correct semblance, I might almost term
it a model in relief, of the face of any mountainous
country. Laugh not, but try it. A slight movement
on your part varies the form and outline and relative
bearing of hill and vale, raises a pinnacle here, or
there sinks a gorge precipitously steep. If I had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
misfortune to be confined to bed by sickness&mdash;excluding
gout, which might render the process impossible&mdash;I
could thus, with the aid of a map and some tables
of distances, design a passable fac-simile of the leading
White Mountains themselves. Why Yankee ingenuity
should not long ago have manufactured <i>papier-maché</i>
plans thereof, in relief, altogether passes my
comprehension. They would sell well as souvenirs
of travel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<h2>SLIDING SCALE OF THE INCONSOLABLES.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>From the French.</i></p>


<p>How rapid is the progress of oblivion, with respect
to those who are no more! How many a quadrille
shall we see, this winter, exclusively made up from
the ranks of inconsolable widows! Widows of this
order exist only in the literature of the tombstone.
In the world, and after the lapse of a certain period,
there is but one sort of widows inconsolable&mdash;those
who refuse to be comforted, because they can't get
married again!</p>

<p>One of our most distinguished sculptors was summoned,
a short time since, to the house of a young
lady, connected by birth with a family of the highest
grade in the aristocracy of wealth, and united in marriage
to the heir of a title illustrious in the military
annals of the Empire.</p>

<p>The union, formed under the happiest auspices,
had been, alas! of short duration. Death, unpitying
death, had ruptured it, by prematurely carrying off
the young husband. The sculptor was summoned by
the widow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>He traversed apartments silent and deserted, until
he was introduced into a bed-room, and found himself
in presence of a lady, young and beautiful, but habited
in the deepest mourning, and with a face furrowed by
tears.</p>

<p>"You are aware," said she, with a painful effort
and a voice half choked by sobs, "You are aware of
the blow which I have received?"</p>

<p>The artist bowed, with an air of respectful condolence.</p>

<p>"Sir," continued the widow, "I am anxious to
have a funeral monument erected, in honour of the
husband whom I have lost."</p>

<p>The artist bowed again.</p>

<p>"I wish that the monument should be superb, worthy
of the man whose loss I weep, proportioned to
the unending grief into which his loss has plunged
me. I care not what it costs. I am rich, and I will
willingly sacrifice all my fortune to do honour to the
memory of an adored husband. I must have a temple&mdash;with
columns&mdash;in marble&mdash;and in the middle&mdash;on
a pedestal&mdash;his statue."</p>

<p>"I will do my best to fulfill your wishes, Madam,"
replied the artist; "but I had not the honour of acquaintance
with the deceased, and a likeness of him
is indispensable for the due execution of my work.
Without doubt, you have his portrait?"</p>

<p>The widow raised her arm, and pointed despairingly
to a splendid likeness by Amaury Duval.</p>

<p>"A most admirable picture!" observed the artist;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
"and the painter's name is sufficient guarantee for its
striking resemblance to the original."</p>

<p>"Those are his very features, Sir; it is himself.
It wants but life. Ah! Would that I could restore it
to him at the cost of all my blood!"</p>

<p>"I will have this portrait carried to my studio,
Madam, and I promise you that the marble shall reproduce
it exactly."</p>

<p>The widow, at these words, sprung up, and at a single
bound throwing herself towards the picture, with
arms stretched out as though to defend it, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Take away this portrait! carry off my only consolation!
my sole remaining comfort! never! never!"</p>

<p>"But Madam, you will only be deprived of it for a
short time, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not an hour! not a minute! could I exist without
his beloved image! Look you, Sir, I have had it
placed here, in my own room, that my eyes might be
fastened upon it, without ceasing, and through my
tears. His portrait shall never leave this spot one
single instant, and in contemplating that will I pass
the remainder of a miserable and sorrowful existence."</p>

<p>"In that case, Madam, you will be compelled to
permit me to take a copy of it. But do not be uneasy&mdash;I
shall not have occasion to trouble your solitude
for any length of time; one sketch&mdash;one sitting
will suffice."</p>

<p>The widow agreed to this arrangement; she only
insisted that the artist should come back the following
day. She wanted him to set to work on the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>stant,
so great was her longing to see the mausoleum
erected. The sculptor, however, remarked that he
had another work to finish first. This difficulty she
sought to overcome by means of money.</p>

<p>"Impossible," replied the artist, "I have given
my word; but do not distress yourself; I will apply
to it so diligently, that the monument shall be finished
in as short a time as any other sculptor would require,
who could apply himself to it forthwith."</p>

<p>"You see my distress," said the widow; "you can
make allowance for my impatience. Be speedy, then,
and above all, be lavish of magnificence. Spare no
expense; only let me have a masterpiece."</p>

<p>Several letters echoed these injunctions, during the
few days immediately following the interview.</p>

<p>At the expiration of three months the artist called
again. He found the widow still in weeds, but a little
less pallid, and a little more coquettishly dressed in
her mourning garb.</p>

<p>"Madam," said he, "I am entirely at your service."</p>

<p>"Ah! at last; this is fortunate," replied the widow,
with a gracious smile.</p>

<p>"I have made my design, but I still want one sitting,
for the likeness. Will you permit me to go into
your bed-room?"</p>

<p>"Into my bed-room? For what?"</p>

<p>"To look at the portrait again."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes; have the goodness to walk into the drawing-room;
you will find it there now."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Yes; it hangs better there; it is better lighted in
the drawing-room, than in my own room."</p>

<p>"Would you like, Madam, to look at the design for
the monument?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure. Oh! what a size! What profusion
of decorations! Why, it is a palace, Sir, this
tomb!"</p>

<p>"Did you not tell me, Madam, that nothing could
be too magnificent? I have not considered the expense;
and by the way, here is a memorandum of
what the monument will cost you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Heavens!" exclaimed the widow, after having
cast an eye over the total adding-up. "Why, this is
enormous!"</p>

<p>"You begged me to spare no expense."</p>

<p>"Yes, no doubt, I desire to do things properly, but
not exactly to make a fool of myself."</p>

<p>"This, at present, you see, is only a design; and
there is time yet to cut it down."</p>

<p>"Well, then, suppose we were to leave out the temple,
and the columns, and all the architectural part,
and content ourselves with the statue? It seems to
me that would be very appropriate."</p>

<p>"Certainly it would."</p>

<p>"So let it be, then&mdash;just the statue alone."</p>

<p>Shortly after this second visit, the sculptor fell desperately
ill. He was compelled to give up work; but,
on returning from a tour in Italy, prescribed by his
physician, he presented himself once more before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
widow, who was then in the tenth month of her mourning.
He found, this time, a few roses among the cypress,
and some smiling colours playing over half-shaded
grounds.</p>

<p>The artist brought with him a little model of his
statue, done in plaster, and offering in miniature the
idea of what his work was to be.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the likeness?" he inquired
of the widow.</p>

<p>"It seems to me a little flattered; my husband was
all very well, no doubt; but you are making him an
Apollo!"</p>

<p>"Really? well, then, I can correct my work by the
portrait."</p>

<p>"Don't take the trouble&mdash;a little more, or less like,
what does it matter?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, but I am particular about likenesses."</p>

<p>"If you absolutely must&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is in the drawing-room, yonder, is it not? I'll
go in there."</p>

<p>"It is not there any longer," replied the widow,
ringing the bell.</p>

<p>"Baptiste," said she to the servant who came in,
"bring down the portrait of your master."</p>

<p>"The portrait that you sent up to the garret, last
week, Madam?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened, and a young man
of distinguished air entered; his manners were easy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
familiar, he kissed the fair widow's hand, and tenderly
inquired after her health.</p>

<p>"Who in the world is this good man in plaster?"
asked he, pointing with his finger to the statuette,
which the artist had placed upon the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>"It is the model of a statue for my husband's
tomb."</p>

<p>"You are having a statue of him made? The
devil! it's very majestic!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"It is only great men who are thus cut out of
marble, and at full length; it seems to me, too, that
the deceased was a very ordinary personage."</p>

<p>"In fact, his bust would be sufficient."</p>

<p>"Just as you please, Madam," said the sculptor.</p>

<p>"Well, let it be a bust, that's&mdash;determined!"</p>

<p>Two months later, the artist, carrying the bust, encountered
on the stairs a merry party. The widow,
giving her hand to the elegant dandy who had caused
the statue of the deceased to be cut down, was on his
way to the Mayor's office, where she was about to take
a second oath of conjugal fidelity.</p>

<p>If the bust had not been completed, it would willingly
have been dispensed with. When, some time
later, the artist called for his money, there was an
outcry about the price; and it required very little less
than a threat of legal proceedings, before the widow,
consoled and remarried, concluded by resigning herself
to pay for this funeral homage, reduced as it was,
to the memory of her departed husband.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<h2>RAMBLING RECORDS.</h2>

<p class="center">THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.</p>


<p>**With one exception, however, I gleaned nothing of
information that is not already chronicled in the guide-books;
and that one piece of information I only set down,
because I think it contains a hint that may be made
practically useful in certain enterprising circles of New
York.</p>

<p>We were in the Arena at Arles. It was a splendid
day&mdash;barring the Mistral, that windy nuisance,
which, as it eddied through the antique and ample Roman
corridors, brought to my recollection certain North-Westers
experienced on a fine March day in Union
Square. In fact, it was far too cold for sentimentalizing
or tracing measurements. But the guardian, it
seemed, had not latterly had much chance of exercising
his vocation, and his tongue was too nimble to be frozen.
And so at it he went. Only, being himself more interested
in certain proceedings that had lately taken
place within a boarded fence that now encloses the arena,
than in historical or legendary lore, his subject was by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
many centuries more fresh than the ruins whereon we
stood, sunning ourselves and crouching out of the wind's
way. Arles, it appeared, had been favoured with a
bull fight, real Spanish matadors doing the beastly
honours; but to the credit of the city, be it said, the
spectacle was received with intense disapprobation.
The gentle Provencals, whose tastes are more Italian
than Spanish, could not brook the sport dear to their
fair Empress who sets fashions in Paris. Indeed, the
beauteous Eugénie, I fear, will hold them to be the
merest milk-sops, for when the grand climax of a disembowelled
horse was exhibited before them, the Arlesians,
male and female&mdash;in place of shouts of triumphant
approval&mdash;gave vent to loud cries of shame and execration,
and in short hissed the Spanish heroes incontinently
from the scene of their performance.</p>

<p>But what has all this to do with the future of New
York, it may be asked by any reader of these rambling
reminiscences. Stay, a moment; I am only at the
commencement. I, too inquired if this were all. "By
no means, Sir," was the reply. "We had then the
real <i>courses aux taureaux</i>, and excellent they were."
Now I must own that my notions of this branch of the
tauromachia were somewhat indistinct. I knew it was
not precisely the same thing as buffalo-hunting on the
prairies, or as a steeple-chase in Warwickshire or Yorkshire;
but I could not have defined it to save my life.
"Perhaps, Monsieur, has never seen one" was the next
appropriate suggestion, and it led very naturally to my
enlightenment. Briefly, then, after the torture of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
quadrupeds, and the indignant dismissal of the Spanish
matadors, the young gentlemen of the town took the
place of the latter, and began a diversion, which must
have been infinitely amusing, and which, I humbly submit,
might be adopted on a different soil. A lively
young bull was turned into the arena, and was followed
by a number of lively youths, armed only with light
staves whereon fluttered blood-red pennons. The fun
consists in provoking the excitable animal by the red
flags thrust before his face, and eluding the consequences
by a run, a dodge, or a jump. The fence,
which was a barrier for the bull, could easily be vaulted
by a nimble-footed youth&mdash;and none but such would
venture upon the field. There was just enough danger
to make the game piquant; scarcely enough to make
it objectionable. One indiscreet young fellow did indeed
narrowly escape a catastrophe on the occasion described
to me; but the fault was entirely his own. He had
been breakfasting at some Arlesian Delmonico's, and
had partially lost his wits before coming to the encounter,
while retaining all his courage. Therefore it
happened&mdash;and I only tell the story as it was told me&mdash;that
the youth, when pursued by the bull, tripped
and fell, and the horns of the brute were immediately
thrust into the fullest part of his peg-top trousers. A
great sensation among the spectators! The bull succeeded
in raising and throwing over his head the object
of his attack, but by no means in disentangling himself
therefrom. His frantic efforts to bring about a summary
toss were for some minutes unsuccessful; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
reader may conceive the mingled sense of the ludicrous
and the fearful, that pervaded the assembly. Finally&mdash;for
even French cassimere will give way in the end&mdash;he,
the bull that is, achieved his aim, and threw his
unconscious tormentor a summerset, being diverted
from ulterior measures of vengeance by fresh attacks
made upon him, while the crest-fallen hero of the adventure
was promptly bundled over the paling. To
sum up this sketch of the sport, in the humane and
pithy words of the guardian of the Amphitheatre&mdash;"it
does no harm whatever to the bull, and very little to
the young gentleman."</p>

<p>Now then, Mr. Niblo; why should you not establish
a Tauro-drome in the centre of civilization? The leaning
of the day is toward athletic exercise. In England,
at present, there is a run upon rifle-corps; and the
boldest riders are all bent upon becoming the crackest
shots. In New York, I have read since my absence
in Europe, that the great English Eleven have begotten
a very rage for cricket. An excellent move this;
but then the climate is against it, and the summer is
short, and the game is utterly incomprehensible to
the gentler sex, who are always prompt to encourage
the manly prowess of their admirers. Besides, for lack
of a permanent Bude light of adequate strength, we
have not yet achieved the desideratum of playing cricket
during those special hours when the youth of a commercial
community finds itself prone to relaxation.
The <i>courses aux taureaux</i> might just as well take place
by gas-light and in a New York circus, as amid Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
ruins and under the blaze of sunshine. The dandies
of Broadway have the two main requisites for brilliant
success in this suggested entertainment. Their pluck
may not be doubted; and who that has seen them,
agile and unwearied in the German or the <i>valse à deux
temps</i>, could question their ability to outfoot the fleetest
bull that Andalusia itself could supply? I commend
the matter then to the serious consideration of
Managers in search of novelties, and to belles who
would discover what stuff their beaux are made of.</p>


<p class="center">AT NUREMBURG.</p>


<p>For these thirty-eight years past, the <i>Albion</i> hath
been protesting once a week, in the Latin tongue,
that they who skip over the water change only their
sky, not their mental existence. Nor did I ever doubt&mdash;indeed
I ought to have faith therein&mdash;the truth of
this motto, until I found myself yesterday in one of
the streets of this old city of Nuremburg, with no promenaders
at the moment save myself. There was not
a man in sight, tiled with a black beaver chimney-pot;
nor a woman redolent of the Rue de la Paix or Regent
Street. Then it was that I incontinently asked myself
if I were truly a Briton by birth and an Anglo-American
by local ties; or whether I were not in fact a German
burgher of the middle ages. I should scarcely
have been surprised at sight of grave Albert Durer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
himself coming round the corner, or at hearing Hans
Sachs, the cobbler poet, trolling one of his six thousand
ditties.</p>

<p>To say this, is simply to add the testimony of another
witness to that which has set down Nuremburg as the
city of all Europe least changed with changing times.
The very little that has been done of late years in the
way of repairing and rebuilding, within the walls, has
been done in strict accordance with the prevalent mediæval
style. The result is that&mdash;whereas elsewhere,
when you stumble upon a private dwelling of moderate
proportions showing plainly that it was built some two
or three or four or five centuries ago, you congratulate
yourself upon having discovered a curiosity (as such a
one really would be in Paris, for instance)&mdash;here the
difficult search would be for a house, modern and spruce.
Not that a rectangularly-ornamented gable-end is the
quintessence of architectural beauty, or that a basement
front of low iron-barred windows suggests an
agreeable or hospitable interior. By no means. If
this were all, there would be considerable quaintness,
and nought beyond. But it is otherwise. Some of the
decorative bits that catch the eye right and left, are
absolute gems in their way&mdash;whether oriel windows,
or fantastic turrets, or figures and devices embossed
and sculptured. Taste, generally for the Gothic, but
diverging at a later date into the Renaissance style,
seems to have run riot here in wilful playfulness.</p>

<p>Of the regular sights set down in the hand-books,
and explored by conscientious Englishmen with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Murrays under their arms, it would not be appropriate
to speak at length. I may however indulge in an allusion
to the different material, whereof are constructed
two of the most highly-laboured marvels, here exhibited.
Now the city itself is divided into two nearly
equal parts by the small river Pegnitz, these parts
bearing the names respectively of the principal church
that stands in either. The one is dedicated to St. Sebald,
the other to St. Lawrence. The former, as its
chief curiosity, contains the shrine of its patron Saint,
an elaborate and most exquisitely wrought fretwork
canopy, about fifteen feet in height, beneath which repose
his remains. The design is in a measure architectural,
and Gothic of course; but the ornamentation
is its great glory, though one is staggered somewhat
at the irreverent juxtaposition of the twelve Apostles
with Cupids and Mermaids, and at sundry Fathers of
the Church disporting themselves amid clusters of fruit
and bouquets of flowers. This monument of artistic
skill was the work of Peter Vischer, one of the worthies
of Nuremburg, and has been completed three hundred
and forty years. The able worker, having dispensed
with consistency in the admixture of Christian and
Pagan accessories, as I have mentioned, was at least
justified in introducing a figure of himself as one of the
human animals; and a very fine statuette he makes,
with chisel in hand and his working apron about him.
Now mark, if you please, O attentive reader, this shrine
of St. Sebald is entirely cast in bronze. To say that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
effect is beautiful, is too limited praise. It is harmonious;
thoroughly satisfying to the eye; perfect.</p>

<p>Cross with me now, if you be not weary, one of the
dozen picturesque bridges over the Pegnitz, and let
us see what Adam Krafft, another great Nuremburger
of that same age, has done in the same line of Gothic
decoration for the Church of St. Lawrence. His work
is a shrine, or I should rather say a repository for the
sacramental wafer of the Roman Catholic rite. It is
an open-work spire, tapering to the height of sixty feet,
with an infinity of graceful detail, and rare sculptures
in high and low relief. One fantasy is, I think, unique
of its kind. The roof is a little too low to admit the
crowning summit fairly; and the top, therefore, has
been made to bend over. The effect&mdash;purposely designed,
I cannot doubt&mdash;is odd; nor can I agree with
the fantastic remark of Murray's Handbook, that it
"has the air of a plant which is chocked in its further
growth." Spires and plants are not endowed with
equal pliability, and the idea of one of the former waving
about, or nodding gracefully, suggests an immediate
"stand from under." And this all the more in
this instance, because&mdash;which brings me thus round-aboutedly
to my main point&mdash;the material hereon employed
is stone, a clean and white-toned stone, that
looks as though its excellent carvings and mouldings
had been completed only for the last Crystal Palace
Exhibition. The apparent newness is downright provoking;
and if Adam Krafft could peep at it from his
honoured grave, he would never dream that he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
lain therein three centuries and a half. Let me say
further&mdash;having thus stumbled upon personalities&mdash;that
he too made himself as durable as his work.
And with more modesty than Master Peter Vischer
above named, who moulded for himself a niche in his
monument corresponding, in size and position, to the
one assigned to the patron Saint, though being at the
opposite end of the shrine, the glorifier and the glorified
could not be taken into one glance and a comparison
forced. There was more modesty, I say, in Adam
Krafft's mode of travelling down the stream of Time
as showman of his show, though he was not methinks
without a dash of <i>craft</i>, as befits the bearer of his name.
Down upon their marrow-bones (as the school boys
have it) with rounded backs grope Adam and his two apprentices,
the three backs forming a base of operations,
or in plainer words upholding the sixty-feet structure,
and doing for it that which is done beneath his rival's
shrine by a snail at each of the four corners. Perhaps,
after all, the sculptor-architect was wiser than the
bronze-caster, in his mode of identifying himself with
his work. Amid a multitude of figures and emblems,
Peter Vischer, as well as St. Sebald, may be overlooked,
for they are small in size; but you can scarcely
avoid asking "who are these three?" when you
note how lofty is the edifice that the large quasi-Atlases
bear.</p>

<p>Enough, touching these minor differences. The essential
one, whereof I intended to speak, is the material
in which the pair wrought respectively. I have said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
that the bronze entirely satisfied my critical eye, which
is tantamount to saying that it charmed me. Not so
with the stone. It is obviously ill-adapted for detached
ornamentation, needing the solid adjunct of buttress,
window, wall, or pillar, just as ivy needs the oak,
or (may I utter such a term?) lace the woman. Indeed,
with all my admiration for sundry mediæval specimens
of Gothic architecture, wherein I scarcely yield
to John Ruskin himself, I confess that the famous
Eleanor's Crosses in England never quite pleased me,
because therein the tracery and dainty delicacies of the
design are not backed by anything massive. The
greater part of my readers will not agree with me.
I am sorry, but can't help it. Only, I don't want to
see any more open-work baskets in stone. Give me
the most fantastical of Gothic devices, as many as you
please, so long as they have something to cling to.</p>

<p>Finally, I have fallen quite in love with this quaint,
irregular old place. Nor do I know how long I might
have loitered, had not the inevitable disillusion come,
as come it will over so many promising things and fair.
Otherwise I might have gone back&mdash;in imagination&mdash;to
those honest old times of Durer, Vischer, Krafft, and
Company, and imagined myself a free burgher of a
free city. But the spell was doubly broken. At the
old castle&mdash;whereof some small apartments are unpretendingly
fitted up for the King and Queen of Bavaria&mdash;there
comes upon one, in another part thereof, a vision
of certain instruments of torture, used undoubtedly
in those good old times to keep the burghers submiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>ive
to their oligarchy of merchant princes. And
again at the Rath-haus, or Hotel de Ville; the maidenly
show-woman lighted us by lanthorn-light through
a set of subterranean dungeons, too numerous to have
been destined for offenders only against the criminal
laws, too horrible to be sanctioned under our creed of
comparative gentleness. And so, on the whole, I returned
back to actual existence, and to all the boredom
of Parliamentary conflicts and Presidential elections,
with a certain sense of relief.</p>


<p class="center">ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.</p>


<p>By dint of many rambles I am become fairly versed
in the topography of Rome; but its history, as elucidated
by monuments or relics, is a perpetual riddle
to the beholder. The Republic, the Empire, the Barbarian
Invasions, Free Lances, Barons, Kings, and
Popes&mdash;all are suggested; all come before you in confused
array; not unfrequently, three or four at once.
You shall go into a church to hear mass amid modern
tawdriness, entering through a mediæval porch, taking
your place between walls that were put up long before
the Christian era, and under a roof supported by pillars
whereon the sun of Phrygia has shone. Pagan and
Christian&mdash;all is jumbled; until finally, unless you
have the patience of Job and the zeal of an antiquarian,
you begin to doubt all legendary and historic lore, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to measure what you see by its external attractiveness
alone. One thing, however, is clearly marked. You
are groping about, in a state of vexed uncertainty;
suddenly you come upon an inscription, conspicuous,
in large legible letters, often gilded. Now you are
grateful. You stride up; and lo, there stands, emblazoned
before you the interesting fact that such or
such a Pontifex Maximus, some Benedict, or Clemens,
or Pius, or Leo, or Gregory, restored, excavated, ornamented,
or built, as the case may have been, the object
upon which you have been pondering. Neither,
in the dearth of desirable information, are you compensated
by the opportunity of picking up chronological
knowledge in regard to the Papacy. These fulsome
records omit, not only all description that might be
useful; they fail to mention the year of the World, or
the year of Grace, altogether. In place thereof, you
learn that the digging or decoration in question took
place in a certain year of the reign of a certain Pope;
but as the chair of St. Peter has had one hundred and
sixteen occupants, between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1860,
"Anno VI. of Innocent VI." or "Anno II. of Julius
II." does not materially aid the memory as to dates.
This petty craving after chiselled or painted immortality
is nowhere more contemptibly exhibited than in
Raphael's famous Loggie at the Vatican, where, over
each separate window, one reads in staring type, "Leo
X., Pontifex Maximus." Surely there is something
strangely inconsistent, in a power that boasts its re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>mote
origin and its endowment in perpetuity, thus taking
infinite pains to isolate its historical fragments.</p>

<p>A smile only&mdash;not a grunt of indignation&mdash;is elicited
by another peculiarity of Rome, which comes under
the lounger's notice. Something of the same sort is
perhaps also observable in all large cities; but it never
struck me so strongly. I allude to the names of the
streets and squares and public places, which names by the
way are carefully and prominently labelled. The jumble
is curious, though one starts a little at times from what
to Protestant eyes seems irreverent. Take a sample,
dispensing with the titles in Italian. You may stroll
through the street of the Three Virgins, of the Three
Robbers, of Jesus, of the Tarpeian Rock, of the Two
Butchers' Shops, of the Baboon, of Divine Love, of the
New Benches, of the Prefects, of the House-tops, of
Jesus and Mary, of the Greeks, of the Tower of Blood,
of the Triton, of the Guardian Angel, of the Strumpet,
of the Soul, of the Scrofula, of the Eagle, of the Lion's
Mouth, of the Five Moons, of Minerva, of the Incurables,
of the Wind, of the Wolf, of St. John Beheaded.
You may halt in the square of the Mouth of Truth, in
that of the Field of Flowers, in that of the Satyrs, in
that of Consolation, in that of the Goose. It is evident
that no ruling mind or principle has regulated this public
nomenclature. <i>Tot homines, quot sententiæ.</i></p>

<p>And is it not the same thing in private affairs?
What variety of tastes! Here is a specimen. Two
young men of my acquaintance, who have been campaigning
in India, arrived here, the other day, on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
first visit. One of them had a relative here, of a scholastic
turn of mind, who was bringing a protracted sojourn
to a close; and to him the cavalry officers were
in a measure consigned. "Can you tell me what's to
be seen at Ostia and Veii?" said one of them to me,
forty-eight hours after their arrival. "Our friend, B.,
is going to take us a day's excursion to each place, to-morrow
and the following day." I could scarcely keep
my countenance. The poor innocents were sold to an
antiquarian. Ostia is destitute of any objects that
would repay a half-hour's walk. As for Veii, the
learned have only agreed of late whereabouts that ancient
city stood.</p>


<p class="center">BRIGANDS, BEGGARS, AND SOUVENIRS.</p>


<p>My last communication was from Rome. It was
piquant, on the day of departure thence from Naples,
to dine at Terracina with a Prussian family, who had
been stopped and robbed by brigands, at eight o'clock
the previous morning, at a spot between Velletri and
Cisterna. There was however no <i>Fra Diavolo</i> in the
case. The respectable <i>père de famille</i>, who with his
sons and daughters had been laid under contribution,
informed us that the fellows were evidently peasants
unused to the trade; that they presented guns, in exacting
their demand for money; but that they were
nervous in their brief operation, and that they did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
ransack the trunks, nor even carry off the watches and
rings of the party. The chief sufferer was the vetturino,
whom fright and the loss of thirty-six dollars
had thrown into a fever, causing the detention which
brought us into contact with the narrators. We passed
on our way, without adventure; the safest period, there
as elsewhere, being that which immediately follows one.
I incline to think that extreme destitution induced
this recourse to a practice almost obsolete, as it probably
gave rise to the personal robberies, unattended
with violence, which have been recently rife in Rome
itself.</p>

<p>And in connection with this point, I may swell the
laments of late travellers as to the chronic prevalence,
throughout Southern Italy, of those other unceasing
robberies of extortion and mendicancy, which are so
much more difficult of toleration. I declare that of all
the mythical personages of classic lore brought back
to one's memory by local association, whether in the
Elysian Fields or on the borders of Lake Avernus, the
Harpies are those who alone survive, and who obtrude
themselves always and everywhere, in season and out
of season. The foul brood have assumed human semblance,
and haunt you in all varieties. The unbidden
cicerone, or the sturdy beggar&mdash;it is hard to say
which is the worse.</p>

<p>How I anathematized them both at Sorrento, where
there are certain souvenirs of Tasso, not so direct and
tangible as those preserved in the Convent of San
Onofrio at Rome, but which are worth the tracing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
You will remember that the hapless poet found a resting
place here in the house of his sister, after he escaped
from his seven years' imprisonment at Ferrara.
To be adjured, for charity, in the name of the Virgin
and every Saint in the calendar&mdash;to have a jackass and
a guide, or a jackass of a guide, thrust upon you, <i>nolens
volens</i> for an excursion that you have no mind to
take, or to be importuned to "put out, put out, put
out to sea," when you know that March winds and
waves make the azure grotto of Capri totally inaccessible&mdash;these
diversions, I say, do not assist one in gathering
up one's reminiscences of Tasso, however much
they may chasten and so improve the temper.</p>

<p>And here I may observe also upon a peculiarity that
marks the research of certain travellers, somewhat
akin perhaps to the taste which induces certain readers
to trace history through personal memoirs, in place of
studying broader narrations. If truth were told, there
are a hundred who commune with Pepys and Horace
Walpole, to ten who find delight in Hume. So is it&mdash;though
by no means in the same proportion&mdash;with
sight-seers on ground that is rich in historical associations.
All their sympathies, or the larger portion of
them at least, are with individuals, as though there
were no grappling with a race, a nation, an age that
is past. Stories, wholly or in part fictitious, are their
hand-books. To them the Capitol of Rome is the scene
of Rienzi's rise and fall, as interpreted by Bulwer Lytton.
At Pompeii their chief care is to find out the
abode of Glaucus and Ione. Nor can it be denied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
that there is an additional charm in this mode of viewing
localities that are new to us, if it be not the most
philosophical. In my own case, without needless parading
of the degree in which I share this gentle weakness
or disapprove it, I must own that its exercise gives
at times an unexpected zest to a ramble. Whilst in
Rome, for instance, I do not think that one's serious
views of history or art are in any manner jarred upon,
because here and there one stumbles upon relics that
savour of individuality. At any rate I should not
like to have missed the old mansion of the Anviti family,
near the bridge of St. Angelo, mentioned by that
old gossip, Benvenuto Cellini, as the frequent rendezvous
of Michael Angelo, Raffaele, Cardinal Bembo,
and other choice spirits of his day. I should have
been sorry to have omitted a visit to the boudoir of
Lucrezia Borgia, in the Convent close beside the church
of St. Pietro in Vincolo, once the residence of Pope
Alexander VI., and now mainly converted into a barrack
for the troops of "the elder son of the Church."
The part however in which is placed this small apartment,
decorated with frescoes of the period, is still
applied to conventual purposes. There is no legend
about the matter, at least so far as regards the possession
of the Borgia family; and the room being small
in size, and unique in situation and style of ornament
within and without, it is not difficult to believe that it
was the chosen resort of a young lady in days when
there was less gadding about than now. Still, to be
candid, I must own that in musing here, as in looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
at the lock of the same amiable woman's hair preserved
in the Ambrosian Library of Milan, one is apt
to have one's recollections of mediæval depravity not
slightly tinctured by visions of Giulia Grisi in the prime
of her voice and beauty, to say nothing of Victor Hugo's
grand drama, and old Mademoiselle Georges' unrivalled
performance therein.</p>

<p>Again, and lastly&mdash;lest the reader imagine that
when once I get back to Rome, I am spell-bound and
cannot leave it&mdash;what traveller has not cast a pleased
eye upwards towards the window whence the baker's
daughter, A. D. 1515, or thereabouts, ogled the young
prince of painters as he passed by on his way to, or
from his work, at the Farnesina Palace? You know
the precise spot, O Viator, in a small piazza very near
the Ponte Sisto? The house is white-washed or yellow-washed
now; but there is the old Ionic pilaster, yet
embedded in the wall, and the ornamental architectural
mouldings yet shut in the Fornarina's window.
And here it occurs to me to make one more digression,
for the purpose of suggesting a theory of my own
touching one of the many portraits of La Fornarina
that have come down to us, and that vary so much in
expression though all evidently intended for the same
person. Between the fine one in the Tribune at Florence,
and the filthy one in the Sciarra Palace at Rome,
there is the widest possible difference. The former is
evidently enough a woman unrefined, though beautiful;
but there is neither coarseness nor indelicacy in the
portraiture. The latter has both these characteristics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
pushed to an extreme that is repulsive. It is said to
be a copy from Raffaele by Giulio Romano. Now my
belief is, that it was painted as a quiz upon his master's
grace and delicacy, by the scapegrace pupil who
ran counter to those special attributes. Meretricious,
ugly, and vulgar, this wretched creature bears emblasoned
in large letters on the bracelet upon her arm
the name of Raffaele Sanzio d'Urbino. This piece of
impudence seems to me the crowning touch. I can't
credit that such a Fornarina ever came from Raffaele's
easel. I do think that a coarse-minded and coarse-handed
young artist may have made fun of his superior
in oil&mdash;as modern literary wags have sometimes
done in ink&mdash;and that Raffaele therefore is in no way
answerable for that caricature in the Sciarra, which
affects to be a reproduction from himself.</p>


<p class="center">LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.</p>


<p>Verily there is no lack of the plainer symbols of
humanity, to remind the wanderer that Childe Harold
was bitterly truthful, when he appended to his inimitable
descriptions of the Alps the assertion that they</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">"serve to show,</span><br />
How Earth may pierce to Heaven, yet leave vain man below."<br />
</p>

<p>The impertinences and follies that are penned by
men and women in the various Livres des Voyageurs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
wherein they record their names, were alone sufficient
proof of this. It is true that enthusiasm and fine feeling
cannot endure for an indefinite period; and that
he would be a sorry companion who always brought his
stilts to the dinner-table. Still, one must regret that
a certain craving for notoriety seems to impel so many
a tourist to write himself down an ass, whilst no sense
of fairness restrains others from commenting, appropriately
or inappropriately, upon the names or remarks
of predecessors. There is a cowardice and cruelty
herein which has, I confess, sometimes made me angry,
when the identity, characters, and conduct of the individuals
concerned were alike unknown or indifferent to
me. In place, however, of prolonging this digression,
and without the least notion of proving anything whatever
by the citation, I beg to offer the reader a brace
of extracts from the visitors' record book at the Montanvert.</p>

<p>The first tickled me exceedingly, as a genuine specimen
of the so-called Irish Bull. Mr. Somebody had
entered his name, and added thereto this valuable bit
of information: "Walked up from Chamouni in four
hours and a-half, <i>having lost the greater part of his
way</i>?" The italics are mine, of course; but is not
the <i>mot</i> worth its space in print?</p>

<p>My other extract concerns some of my young countrywomen,
and I trust that their countrywomen who
may read it will forgive me for putting it into circulation.
They are very poor laughers, who never laugh
when the joke tells against themselves; in this instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
it is we who pay the piper. A party of English school
girls had been lately at Montanvert with their governess,
and had set down their names one after another
in the big book, as is the custom there. A waggish
Frenchman, waiting of course until their backs were
turned, had bracketted the list, and written against the
conclave this pithy and caustic criticism: "<i>Teint rouge;
appétit géant; langage embarrassé.</i>" What an ungallant
scamp! Yet it must be owned that the same absurd
album is rich in provocatives. A running fire of
sarcasm, exchanged between English and French tourists,
marks almost every page.</p>


<p class="center">A SINGULAR ANAGRAM.</p>


<p>Among the curiosities&mdash;not of literature&mdash;but of letters,
the Anagram was wont to be a favourite in the
days of a by-gone generation. Who, for instance, has
not smiled blandly over that famous transposition,
which aptly converts "Horatio Nelson" into <i>Honor
est à Nilo</i>?</p>

<p>The taste, however, for this sort of laborious trifling
has almost passed away; nor do we propose to re-open
the subject of cabalistic lettering. Our only purport
is to offer a new specimen of its eccentricities, which
came upon us recently during a vain attempt to solve
certain mysteries, that occupy just now many serious
minds. It is commended alike to snappers-up of un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>considered
trifles, and to readers who chance to be imbued
with a little tinge of superstitious sensitiveness.
We strive to hope that, though almost as curious, it is
not so unimpeachably appropriate as the one quoted
above. The name, so much in men's mouths, "Louis
Napoleon Bonaparte," may by this method be converted
into, <i>An open plot&mdash;arouse, Albion</i>!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

of real life is sometimes closely assimilated to blank verse.</p></blockquote>


<p>
When, in their course, human events compel<br />
One people to dissolve the social bands<br />
That linked them with another, and to take<br />
Among the powers of the Earth that station,<br />
Equal and separate, to which the laws<br />
Of Nature and of Nature's God, by right,<br />
Entitle them&mdash;respect to the opinions<br />
Of fellow men calls on them to declare<br />
The causes, which have rendered necessary<br />
Such separation.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">We, then, hold these truths</span><br />
To be self-evident: That all mankind<br />
Are equal, and endowed by their Creator<br />
With certain unalienable rights:<br />
That amongst these are Life, and Liberty,<br />
And the Pursuit of Happiness: That men,<br />
To make these rights available and safe,<br />
Have instituted Governments, deriving<br />
Their lawful power from the free consent<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span><br />
Of those they govern: That when any form<br />
Of Government is proved to be destructive<br />
Of these their ends, it is the People's right<br />
To alter, or abolish it, and found<br />
A Government anew, with principles<br />
So laid for its foundation, and with powers<br />
In such form organized, as shall to them<br />
Seem most conducive to their happiness<br />
And safety.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Prudence will, indeed, dictate</span><br />
That long-established Governments should not<br />
Be changed for any light or transient cause:<br />
And all experience, accordingly,<br />
Hath shown that men are more disposed to suffer,<br />
So long as evils are endurable,<br />
Than to assert their rights, and throw aside<br />
Their customary forms. But when abuses<br />
And usurpations, in a lengthened train,<br />
Pursue an object steadfastly, evincing<br />
A firm design to bow them down beneath<br />
Absolute despotism, it is their right,<br />
It is their bounden duty, to throw off<br />
Such Government, and to provide new guards<br />
For their security in future.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Such</span><br />
Has been the patient sufferance of these<br />
Our Colonies, and such is now the need,<br />
That forces them to change their present systems<br />
Of Government. Great Britain's present King<br />
Hath made his history the history<br />
Of usurpation, and of injuries<br />
Often repeated, and directly tending<br />
To the establishment of Tyranny<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span><br />
Over these States: to prove this, let the World<br />
In candour listen to undoubted facts.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He has refused to give assent to laws,</span><br />
Wholesome, and needful for the public good.<br />
He has denied his Governors the power<br />
To sanction laws of pressing urgency,<br />
Unless suspended in their operation,<br />
Till his assent should be obtained; and when<br />
Suspended thus, he has failed wilfully<br />
To give them further thought. He has refused<br />
To sanction other laws, deemed advantageous<br />
To districts thickly peopled, unless they,<br />
Who dwelt therein, would basely throw away<br />
Their right to representatives&mdash;a right<br />
Inestimable, to themselves and only<br />
To Tyrants formidable. In the hope<br />
To weary them into a weak compliance<br />
With his obnoxious measures, he has summoned<br />
The Legislative Bodies to assemble<br />
At places inconvenient, and unusual,<br />
And whence their public records were remote.<br />
He has repeatedly dissolved the Houses<br />
Of Representatives for interfering<br />
With manly firmness, when he has invaded<br />
The People's rights. Long time he has refused,<br />
After such dissolutions, to convene<br />
Others in lieu of them; whereby, the powers<br />
Of Legislation, since they might not be<br />
Annihilated, have for exercise<br />
Been forced upon the body of the people;<br />
Leaving, meanwhile, the unprotected State<br />
To dangers of invasion from without,<br />
And inward anarchy. He has endeavoured<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span><br />
To check the population of these States,<br />
Thwarting the laws for naturalization<br />
Of foreigners, withholding his assent<br />
From other laws, that might encourage them<br />
In immigrating hither, and enhancing<br />
The price of new allotments of the soil.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He has obstructed the administration</span><br />
Of Justice, by his veto on the laws<br />
Establishing judiciary powers<br />
He has made Judges on his will alone<br />
Dependent, for the tenure of their office,<br />
For the amount, and for the proper payment<br />
Of their emoluments. He has erected<br />
New offices in multitudes, and sent<br />
Swarms of his officers to harass us,<br />
And to eat out our substance. He has kept,<br />
In times of peace, among us, standing armies,<br />
Without the sanction of our Legislatures.<br />
His aim has been to place the military<br />
Above the civil power, and beyond<br />
Its just control. He has combined with others<br />
To make us subject to a jurisdiction,<br />
In spirit foreign to our Constitution,<br />
And unacknowledged by our laws; assenting<br />
To acts, that they have passed with semblance only<br />
Of legislation: Acts for quartering<br />
Among us bodies of armed troops: For shielding,<br />
By a mock trial, those their instruments<br />
From punishment for any murders done<br />
On our inhabitants: For cutting off<br />
Our trade with every quarter of the world&mdash;<br />
For laying on us taxes not approved<br />
By our consent: For oft-times robbing us<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span><br />
Of any benefit that might attend<br />
Trial by jury: For transporting us<br />
Beyond the seas, to answer for offences,<br />
Imputed to us: For abolishing,<br />
Within a neighbouring province, the free system<br />
Of English laws; establishing therein<br />
An arbitrary power; and enlarging<br />
Its boundaries, to render it at once<br />
The fit example, and the instrument<br />
For bringing into these our Colonies<br />
The same despotic rule: For taking from us<br />
Our Charters; and abolishing our laws<br />
Most valued; changing thus, in principle,<br />
Our forms of Government: And for suspending<br />
Our Legislatures, with the declaration<br />
That they, themselves, in each and every case,<br />
Were vested with supreme authority<br />
To legislate for us.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">He has laid down</span><br />
His sway, by holding us without the pale<br />
Of his protection, and by waging war<br />
Against us. He has plundered on our seas;<br />
Ravaged our coasts; our cities burnt; and taken<br />
Our people's lives. He is transporting hither<br />
Armies composed of foreign mercenaries,<br />
To end the works of death, and desolation,<br />
And tyranny, begun with circumstances<br />
Of cruelty and perfidy unequalled<br />
In the most barbarous ages, and unworthy<br />
The Ruler of a nation civilized.<br />
He has constrained our fellow-citizens,<br />
On the high seas made captive, to bear arms<br />
Against their country, and of friends and brothers<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span><br />
To be the executioners, or fall<br />
Beneath his creatures' hands. He has excited<br />
Amongst ourselves domestic insurrection;<br />
And sought to bring on the inhabitants<br />
Of our frontier the savage Indian,<br />
Whose code of warfare, merciless and sure,<br />
Spares not, in undistinguished massacre,<br />
Age, sex, condition.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">We, in every stage</span><br />
Of these oppressions, have in humblest terms<br />
Petitioned for redress. To our petitions,<br />
Though oft repeated, there has been <i>one</i> answer&mdash;<br />
Repeated injury.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">A prince, whose life</span><br />
And conduct thus are marked by every act<br />
That may define a Tyrant, is unfit<br />
To rule o'er Freemen.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Neither have we failed</span><br />
In due attention to our British brethren.<br />
From time to time, we have admonished them<br />
Of efforts, by their Legislature made,<br />
Unwarrantably to extend to us<br />
Their jurisdiction. How we emigrated,<br />
And settled here, we have reminded them.<br />
We to their native justice have appealed<br />
And magnanimity; and have conjured them,<br />
By common kindred ties, to disavow<br />
These usurpations, which, inevitably,<br />
Would mar our intercourse and friendship. They<br />
Have also turned a deaf ear to the voice<br />
Of Justice and of Consanguinity.<br />
So must we yield to the necessity<br />
Which forces us to separate, and hold them&mdash;<br />

Peace, and contract alliances, establish<br />
Commerce, and do all other acts and things<br />

<h2>BEL PIEDE.</h2>

Browning, whose household gods were planted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beside the banks of classic Arno,</span><br />
Once, in a dainty ballad, chanted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lady of the <i>bella mano</i>.</span><br />
<br />
Pass from the Arno to the Tiber,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Tuscan to a Roman lady;</span><br />
And let a humbler bard describe her&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This fair one of the <i>bel piede</i>.</span><br />
<br />
To Roman dame, as I and you know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is rarely given a foot symmetrical;</span><br />
No Cinderellas&mdash;many a Juno&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the Pincian we can yet recall.</span><br />
<br />
Those were the days when bonnets did not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Expose the face to every starer;</span><br />
When skirts, worn short and airy, hid not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The foot and ankle of the wearer.</span><br />
<br />
With high arched instep, narrow, tapering,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Divinely booted&mdash;none could beat hers&mdash;</span><br />
The foot, that set my young heart capering,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came down the broad steps of St. Peter's.</span><br />
<br />
Her long black veil, the crowd around me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her swift landau, my swift emotion&mdash;</span><br />
She came: her fairy foot spell-bound me;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She went: which way, I had no notion.</span><br />
<br />
Haunting all public haunts was fruitless,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mid solemn pomps, on festal hey-day;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>Search for those glorious boots was bootless:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rome showed no more my <i>bel piede</i>.</span><br />

In Paris next enchained it held me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through redowa, waltz, all sorts of dances;</span><br />
But mask and domino repelled me&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She moved, but I made no advances.</span><br />
<br />
Again she passed&mdash;no trace behind her&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I sought, enquired, left nothing undone;</span><br />
But all was vain: I could not find her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, in despair, set off for London.</span><br />
<br />
The sea between Boulogne and Dover<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was, as it always is, terrific;</span><br />
Against that awful passage over,<br />

I recked not what might be its meaning&mdash;<br />

<br />
Sudden, a lurch, a shriek, a splashing!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I knew the shriek was from a lady;</span><br />
But horror through my brain went crashing&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I saw, heels up, my <i>bel piede</i>!</span><br />
<br />
She sank. No more! But O ye mermaids,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of whose long tails we've had a surfeit,</span><br />
If ye were worthy to be her maids,<br />

A Spanish writer once decided,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In flippant song,</span><br />
That woman's lip, or tongue, or eye did<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All that went wrong.</span><br />
Nay, that the true mode of unmasking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her wiles would be,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pray, who is she?</span><br />
<br />
Now, why must woman's petticoats<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Aye be the blamables?</span><br />
How is't Quevedo never quotes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mankind's unnamables?</span><br />
He rates the sex, and certès for it he<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Makes a good plea;</span><br />
But can't I, on as good authority,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ask, who is he?</span><br />
<br />
Quevedo swears that Eve and Helen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wrought dire mishaps:</span><br />
That Adam and the Trojans fell in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Their deep-laid traps.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You know't, Quevedo!</span><br />

Beneath the surface let the gazer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Look deep&mdash;he'll see</span><br />
Some stronger vessel that betrays her:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Just ask&mdash;who's he?</span><br />
<br />
Is it a milk-maid drops her pailful?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lubin's love-making:</span><br />
Is her fate scandalous or baleful?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lubin's been raking!</span><br />
The school-girl loaths her bread and butter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pouts o'er her tea,</span><br />
Mumbles her lessons in a flutter&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ask, who is he?</span><br />
<br />
Despite experience, what can set<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The widow hoping?</span><br />
Why are wives sometimes gadding met,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And sometimes moping?</span><br />
Don't talk of widows' amorous bump,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of wives too free;</span><br />
But pop the question to them, plump&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pray, who is he?</span><br />
<br />
We're mighty prompt to throw the blame on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The weaker fair sex;</span><br />
When justice ought to fix the shame on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ours&mdash;not on their sex.</span><br />

The old and hump-backed ply their battery<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of gold and jewels;</span><br />
Well-knit young fellows deal in flattery,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dance, song, oaths, duels.</span><br />
So, to conclude, I'll take my oath, sir,<br />

That, like a Fairy's, ere it come, what's coming can espy:<br />
"I know it all, I know it all," thou would'st perchance reply.<br />
<br />
Were I to tell thee that I roam in sweet, delirious dream,<br />
Haunting thy footsteps so that I thy very shadow seem;<br />
A tinge of sadness on thy cheek, a quick, mistrustful glance,&mdash;<br />
Ninon, thou knowest well that these thy loveliness enhance:<br />
And thus, that thou believest not, thou would'st reply perchance.<br />
<br />
Were I to tell thee that my soul hoards up the lightest word,<br />
That falling from thy lips at eve in our discourse I've heard;<br />
Lady, thou know'st that, when aroused to anger or disdain,<br />
Eyes, though of azure they may be, can still their lightnings rain:<br />
And thine perchance would flashing say, "We must not meet again!"<br />
<br />
Were I to tell thee that by night I wake and think of thee,<br />
And that by day for thee I pray, and weep on bended knee,<br />
Ah! Ninon, when thou laugh'st, the bee, as well thou art aware,<br />
In hovering round thy rosy mouth, that 'twas a flower might swear:<br />
Were I to tell thee all, perchance the laugh would still be there<br />
<br />
But nothing shalt thou know of this. I venture, all untold,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>Calmly to sit beneath thy lamp, and converse with thee hold.<br />
I hear the murmur of thy voice, thy balmy breath inhale;<br />
And thou may'st doubt me, or surmise, or laugh, I shall not quail;<br />
Thine eyes shall see no cause in me, their kindly look to veil.<br />
<br />
By stealth at times, in secret joy, mysterious flowers I glean,<br />
When o'er thy harpsichord at eve enraptured I can lean,<br />
And list from thy harmonious hands what fairy accents flow;<br />
Or in voluptuous waltz, as round with flying feet we go,<br />
I feel thee in mine arms, a reed, that's waving to and fro.<br />
<br />
When from thy side I have been kept by thronged saloons at night,<br />
And in my chamber draw my bolt that shuts the world from sight,<br />
A thousand reminiscences I seize upon, and hold<br />
In jealous grasp; and there, alone, like miser o'er his gold,<br />
To Heaven my heart, all full of thee, with greedy joy unfold.<br />
<br />
I love; and I have learned to speak in cool and careless tone.<br />
I love; nought tells of it. I love; who knows it?&mdash;I alone!<br />
Dear is my secret, dear the pain with which I am oppressed;<br />
And I have sworn to love, without a hope on which to rest;<br />
But not without a taste of joy&mdash;I see thee, and am blest.<br />
<br />
No! not for me! I was not born such bliss supreme to meet:<br />
To die within thy arms, or live contented at thy feet.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>Alas! all proves it&mdash;e'en the grief that fain I would dispel.<br />
Were I to tell thee, ne'ertheless, that, troth, I love thee well:<br />
Blue-eyed brunette, blue-eyed brunette, thine answer who could tell?<br />

<h2>THE LAST OF THE ROMAN GLADIATORS.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="center">The incident, which the following stanzas attempt to describe, is historical.
It is related by Gibbon in his "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire."</p></blockquote>


<p>
Ye, who have the ruins seen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the Coliseum's walls,</span><br />
Think ye, what the sight hath been<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Rome's highest festivals!</span><br />
If your fancy can restore<br />
Crumbled arch and corridor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Call forth the dead;</span><br />
Bid them fill again the seats,<br />
Where now Echo only greets<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The stranger's tread.</span><br />
<br />
Fourteen hundred years are past,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rome hath fallen in her pride,</span><br />
Since the gladiator last<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the Coliseum died.</span><br />
Fourteen hundred years ago,<br />
Tens of thousands thronged the show,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">In joyous guise,</span><br />
On the struggle and the strife,<br />
And the pangs of parting life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Feasting their eyes.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span><br />
Then ye might have heard the roar<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the noble beasts of prey,</span><br />
As they fought and bled, before<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Men less noble far than they.</span><br />
Strength is useless, courage vain,<br />
Beauty saves not&mdash;they are slain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The forest race;</span><br />
Whilst the still unsated crowd<br />
For new victims shout aloud,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">To fill their place.</span><br />
<br />
Hark! the Prætor's stern command<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Costlier sacrifice proclaims;</span><br />
Lo! the gladiatorial band,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Glory of the Roman Games!</span><br />
As they enter, man by man,<br />
Shape and size the people scan<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">With eager glance;</span><br />
And of each ill-fated pair,<br />
That await the signal there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Foretell the chance.</span><br />
<br />
Hark! the trumpet's sudden sound;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lo! the work of death begun:</span><br />
Seas of blood shall drench the ground,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere that deadly work be done.</span><br />
Ha! a moment of delay?<br />
What the lifted hand can stay?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Is there a fear</span><br />
Of Pompeii's fiery shower?<br />
Or, doth Earthquake's giant power<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Make havoc here?</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span><br />
No&mdash;for Nature with a smile<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Looks upon her outraged laws,</span><br />
Man's indignant voice the while<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bidding man in pity pause.</span><br />
See!&mdash;a monk, obscure, unknown,<br />
Christ's disciple, treads alone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The arena's sand,</span><br />
Foe from foe intent to part,<br />
Striving with a zealous heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">But feeble hand.</span><br />
<br />
Would ye seek to know his fate?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Listen to that savage yell!</span><br />
Scorn, derision, fury, hate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Doomed his death&mdash;the martyr fell.</span><br />
Record there is none to show,<br />
Whose the hand that dealt the blow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">That laid him there;</span><br />
Men who gazed, and men who fought,<br />
All alike to madness wrought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The guilt must share.</span><br />
<br />
Whether stoned to death, or slain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the sword, or by the spear,</span><br />
Little recks it&mdash;it were vain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the mists of time to peer.</span><br />
This we know&mdash;the martyr died;<br />
Nor without success had plied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">His work of peace,</span><br />
Since, to expiate that deed,<br />
Rome's Imperial Lord decreed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The Games should cease.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span><br />
Rome obeyed her Lord's commands;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never were those Games renewed:</span><br />
Now the priest of Jesus stands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the gladiator stood.</span><br />
Thanks, Telemachus, to thee,<br />
Sainted martyr, now we see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Altars around;</span><br />
And the spot, where thou of yore<br />
Did'st thy life-blood nobly pour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Is hallowed ground.</span><br />

<h2>THE PRUDENT BRIDE.</h2>


<p>
At Salem Meeting-House, one summer day,<br />
Two lovers, Abby Purkis and John Cole,<br />
Were joined in holy wedlock. Off they started<br />
To spend the honey-moon, gregarious,<br />
At Trenton, Saratoga, and the Falls.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reaching this last-named wonder of the world,</span><br />
They went the usual round; mounted the tower<br />
That overlooks the cataract; stood and watched<br />
The eddying Rapids, and the whirling Pool;<br />
Nor on thy deck, O daring "<i>Maid of the Mist</i>,"<br />
Failed they to buffet the tumultuous roar,<br />
The drenching spray, the seeming perilous plunge<br />
Beneath the Horse-Shoe. Every where, throughout,<br />
Abby was brave; nay, on John's stalwart arm<br />
Leaning, was confident.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">At last they reached</span><br />
The Cavern of the Winds. Then changed her bearing.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>Trembling, she paused. In truth, the howling blasts,<br />
And gusty moans as of imprisoned spirits,<br />
Struck the bride's soul with terror. All aghast,<br />
She stood before the entrance, and refused,<br />
Firmly refused to trust herself within.<br />
John urged&mdash;she would not; coaxed&mdash;'twas all in vain;<br />
Laughed at, and called her "little fool"&mdash;she would not.<br />
Nay more, she prayed him by the love he bore her<br />
Not to set foot himself within a place<br />
So fraught with peril. John was ungallant,<br />
And only laughed the more. Not he the man<br />
To flinch from fisticuffs with Æolus!<br />
Had he not harpooned whales in Arctic seas?<br />
Were not typhoon, white squall, and hurricane<br />
His some time playmates? It was her turn now<br />
To coax, and urge, and crave&mdash;and be denied.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Chafed that her will was not a law to John,</span><br />
Abby was woman still, and sorely grieved<br />
That he should run such risks. She kissed him fondly,<br />
And bade him tread with care, and hasten back.<br />
Her voice was choked with sobs. Her latest words<br />
Were scarcely audible, though through them breathed<br />
Salem's sound training. "John," she faltered forth,<br />
"We know not what may happen: dear, dear John,<br />
"Were it not well that you&mdash;should&mdash;leave&mdash;with&mdash;me&mdash;<br />
"Your&mdash;watch&mdash;and&mdash;pocket-book?"<br />

<h2>THE TRAMPER'S BED&mdash;AND THE KING'S.</h2>


<p>
Down by the side of a sweet clover-stack,<br />
On a summer night, I lie on my back.<br />
Clear space is above me; and there, as I lie,<br />
I look straight up to the stars in the sky.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once, when the King was dethroned by the mob,</span><br />
They swarmed to his palace, to stare or to rob,<br />
And the frightened lackies flung open the doors,<br />
And clouted shoes scraped along polished floors.<br />
Then it was I caught sight of his Majesty's bed,<br />
With its canopy, gilded and carved, overhead;&mdash;<br />
If his Majesty wishes the stars to behold,<br />
And looks up, he can see but the carving and gold!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some night, should my soul be unbound as I sleep,</span><br />
And downward an Angel in search of it sweep,<br />
No bar, no obstruction, would hinder his flight;&mdash;<br />
With a wave of his wings, by my corpse he would light.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But what, if the soul to be loosed were the King's?</span><br />
Could an Angel reach that by the poise of his wings?<br />
Could he easily cleave through a palace his way?<br />
Through ceilings bedizened, through floors in decay&mdash;<br />
Through gorgeous apartments and bare attic rooms,<br />
For lords and for ladies, for valets and grooms&mdash;<br />
Through a quaint peakèd roof rising high o'er the whole&mdash;<br />
Could he enter, and tenderly waft off the soul?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Better, then, is the bed by the sweet clover-stack,</span><br />
With the stars full in view, and the clear Angel's track!<br />
And though much be not mine of this world's pleasant things,<br />
I should care not to barter my couch for the King's!<br />

<h2>THE MOURNFUL BALLAD OF THE "ALABAMA."</h2>


<p>
Captain Semmes is on a cruise<br />
O'er the track that skippers use;<br />
From the Western Isles, to those<br />
Near Nantucket shoals, he goes.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Woe is me, Alabama!</span><br />
<br />
Letters to the merchants tell<br />
Who into his clutches fell;<br />
'Tis the talk of all the town;<br />
News-boys call it up and down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Woe is me, Alabama!</span><br />
<br />
Straight the sons of Commerce came<br />
To their Chamber, crying shame<br />
For the tidings they had learned,<br />
For their ships and cargoes burned.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Woe is me, Alabama!</span><br />
<br />
Up and spake a merchant prince:<br />
"Friends, our city well may wince,<br />
For you have, alas! to know<br />
Of a most disastrous blow!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Woe is me, Alabama!</span><br />
<br />
"All is sunk beneath the waves,<br />
Breadstuffs, lard, tobacco, staves;<br />
Chained have been our Captains bold<br />
In the 'Alabama's' hold!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Woe is me, Alabama!</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span><br />
"Lawless, too, is Captain Semmes;<br />
Neutral shipments he condemns.<br />
Useless is it to appeal<br />
To Consul's signature and seal.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Woe is me, Alabama!</span><br />
<br />
"But there's worse than this behind;<br />
Treacherous friends this blow designed.<br />
Great as is the corsair's guilt,<br />
Greater theirs his ship who built!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Woe is me, Alabama!</span><br />
<br />
"Neutral money, neutral skill,<br />
Wrought us this outrageous ill;<br />
Neutral engines, neutral guns,<br />
Aid him as he fights or runs.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Woe is me, Alabama!</span><br />
<br />
"Sons of Commerce, men of worth,<br />
Let these words of mine go forth!<br />
Let the British monarch know<br />
That to her all this we owe!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Woe is me, Alabama!</span><br />
<br />
So the warning words went forth<br />
To England, from the angered North,<br />
Passed along from mouth to mouth,<br />
"No more dealings with the South!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Woe is me, Alabama!</span><br />
<br />
"You may sell to this our land<br />
All we want of contraband;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>But have a care that nothing goes,<br />
From you, a neutral, to our foes!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Woe is me, Alabama!</span><br />
<br />
Now Heaven preserve us all in peace,<br />
And let these ugly squabbles cease!<br />

<h2>THREE MEN AND A WOMAN.</h2>


<p>
A Summer's dawn and a tranquil sea;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But lurid all with smoke:</span><br />
For a bark was burning furiously,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What time the morning broke.</span><br />
<br />
Terrible? ay, but risk there was none,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For stern the Captain's sway;</span><br />
And when he spoke, each mother's son<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could not but choose obey.</span><br />
<br />
"Man the boats!"&mdash;the boats were manned,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In order, one by one;</span><br />
To pull a hundred miles to land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All under the Summer's sun.</span><br />
<br />
Four stalwart rowers bend to their oars:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Four sitters at the stern&mdash;</span><br />
Three men and a woman&mdash;silent sit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Watching the vessel burn.</span><br />
<br />
They were no tremblers: each had known<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Perils by land and deep;</span><br />
But the woman alone would gently moan,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And at times, perforce, would weep.</span><br />
<br />
Yet soon the sun was high in heaven,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the sea was a-glow: and then</span><br />
The temper of those men peered out&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of those three fearless men.</span><br />
<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One felt they were wrong to risk it,</span><br />
In sweltering heat, with nothing to eat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But a bit of dry ship-biscuit.</span><br />
<br />
The third brooded over his handful of freight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Going down, uninsured, to the deep:</span><br />
But the woman alone would gently moan,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And at times, perforce, would weep;</span><br />
<br />
Till a sense of shame the three o'ercame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a curious wish to know</span><br />
Why, still unfearing, she gave way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To her uncomplaining woe.</span><br />

<h2>ANOTHER MARBLE FAUN.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>A Translation of La Statue, by Victor Hugo.</i></p>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He seemed to shiver, for the wind was keen.</span><br />
'Twas a poor statue underneath a mass<br />
Of leafless branches, with a blackened back<br />
And green foot&mdash;an old isolated Faun<br />
In old deserted park, who, bending forward,<br />
Half merged himself in the entangled boughs,<br />
Half in his marble settings. He was there,<br />
Pensive, and bound to the earth; and, as all things,<br />
Devoid of movement, he was there&mdash;forgotten.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Trees were around him, whipped by the icy blasts&mdash;</span><br />
Gigantic chestnuts, without leaf or bird,<br />
And, like himself, grown old in that same place.<br />
Through the dark network of their undergrowth,<br />
Pallid his aspect; and the earth was brown.<br />
Starless and moonless, a rough winter's night<br />
Was letting down her lappets o'er the mist.<br />
Trees more remote, with sombre shafts upreared,<br />
Each other crossed; and trees remoter still,<br />
By distance blurred, threw up to the grey sky<br />
Their thousand twigs sharp-pointed, intricate;<br />
And posed themselves around; and through the fog<br />
Took, on the horizon's verge, the shadowy form<br />
Of mighty porcupines in countless herd.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This&mdash;nothing more: old Faun, dull sky, dark wood.</span><br />
<br />
Piercing the mist, perchance there might be seen<br />
A distant terrace&mdash;its long layers of stone<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>Tinted with slimy green; or group of Nymphs,<br />
Dimly defined beside a wide-spread basin,<br />
And shrinking&mdash;fitly in this desolate park&mdash;<br />
As once from gazers, from neglect to-day.<br />
The old Faun was laughing. In their dubious haze<br />
Leaving the shamed Nymphs and their dreary basin&mdash;<br />
The old Faun was laughing&mdash;'twas to him I came<br />
Moved to compassion, for these sculptors all<br />
Are pitiless ever, and, content with praise,<br />
Doom Nymphs to shame, condemn the Fauns to laughter.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor helpless marble, how I've pitied it</span><br />
Less often man&mdash;the harder of the two.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So then, without a word that might offend</span><br />
His ear difformed&mdash;for well the marble hears<br />
The voice of thought&mdash;I said to him: "You hail<br />
From the gay amorous age; O Faun, what saw you,<br />
When you were happy? Were you of the Court?<br />
Did you take part in fêtes?&mdash;For your diversion<br />
These Nymphs were fashioned. In this wood, for you,<br />
Capable hands mingled the gods of Greece<br />
With Roman Cæsars; made rare vases peer<br />
Into clear waters; and this garden vext<br />
With tortuous labyrinths. When you were happy,<br />
O Faun, what saw you? All the secrets tell<br />
Of that too vain yet captivating past,<br />
Thick set with prudent love-makers, a past<br />
In which great poets jostled mighty Kings.<br />
How fresh your memory&mdash;you are laughing still!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Speak to me, comely Faun, as you would speak</span><br />
To tree, or zephyr, or untrodden grass.<br />
From end to end of this well-shaded alley,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>When near you, with the handsome Lautrec, passed<br />
The soft-eyed Marguerite, the Bearnaise Queen,<br />
Have you, O Greek, O mocker of old days,<br />
Have you not sometimes with that oblique eye<br />
Winked at the Farnese Hercules?&mdash;Alone,<br />
In cave as it were of foliage green and moist,<br />
Have you, O Faun, considerately turned<br />
From side to side when counsel-seekers came,<br />
And now advised as shepherd; now as satyr?<br />
Have you sometimes upon this very bench<br />
Seen at mid-day, Vincent de Paul instilling<br />
Grace into Gondi?&mdash;Have you ever thrown<br />
That searching glance on Louis with Fontange,<br />
On Anne with Buckingham; and did they not<br />
Start, with flushed cheeks, to hear your laugh ring forth<br />
From corner of the wood?&mdash;Was your advice<br />
As to the thyrsis or the ivy asked,<br />
When, the grand ballet of fantastic form,<br />
God Ph&oelig;bus, or god Pan, and all his court<br />
Turned the fair head of the fair Montespan,<br />
Calling her Amaryllis?&mdash;La Fontaine,<br />
Flying the courtiers' ears of stone, came he,<br />
Tears in his eyelids, to reveal to you<br />
The sorrows of his Nymphs of Vaux?&mdash;What said<br />
Boileau to you, to you, O lettered Faun,<br />
Who once with Virgil, in the Eclogue, held<br />
That charming dialogue, and deftly made&mdash;<br />
Couched on the turf&mdash;the heavy spondee dance<br />
To the light dactyl's step?&mdash;Say, have you seen<br />
Young beauties sporting on the sward: Chevreuse<br />
Of the swimming eyes, Thiange of airs superb?<br />
Have they sometimes, in rosy-tinted group,<br />
Girt you so fondly round, that all at once<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>A straggling sunbeam on a fluttering bosom<br />
Marked your lascivious profile?&mdash;Has your tree<br />
Received beneath the quiet of its shade<br />
Pale Mazarin's scarlet winding sheet?&mdash;Have you<br />
Been honoured with a sight of Molière<br />
In dreamy mood? Has he perchance at times,<br />
Dropping at random a melodious verse,<br />
In tone familiar&mdash;as is the wont<br />
'Twixt demi-gods&mdash;addressed you?&mdash;When at eve<br />
Homeward hereby the thinker went, has he<br />
Who&mdash;seeing souls all naked&mdash;could not fear<br />
Your nudity, in his enquiring mind<br />
Confronted you with Man? And did he deem<br />
You, spectral cynic, the less sad, less cold,<br />
Less wicked, less ironical&mdash;comparing<br />
Your laugh in marble with our human laugh?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under the thickly tangled branches, thus</span><br />
Did I speak to him; he no answer gave&mdash;<br />
Not even a murmur. On the pedestal<br />
Leaning, I listened; but the past stirred not.<br />
Dumb to my words and to my pity deaf,<br />
The Satyr, motionless, was vaguely blanched<br />
By the wan glimmer of the dying day.<br />
To see him there, sinister, half drawn out<br />
From his dark framing, and by damp discoloured,<br />
Brought to one's mind the handle of a sword<br />
In torso chiselled&mdash;an old rusty sword,<br />
Left for long years neglected in its sheath.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I shook my head, and moved myself away.</span><br />
Then, from the copses, from the dried up boughs<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>Pendent above him, from secret caves<br />
Hid in the wood, methought a ghostly voice<br />
Came forth and woke an echo in my soul,<br />
As in the hollow of an amphora.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Imprudent poet," thus it seemed to say,</span><br />
"What dost thou here? Leave the forsaken Fauns<br />
In peace beneath their trees! Dost thou not know,<br />
Poet, that ever it is impious deemed,<br />
In desert spots where drowsy shades repose&mdash;<br />
Though love itself might prompt thee&mdash;to shake down<br />
The moss that hangs from ruined centuries,<br />
And, with the vain noise of thine ill-timed words,<br />
To mar the recollections of the dead?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then to the gardens all enwrapped in mist</span><br />
I hurried, dreaming of the vanished days.<br />
And still the tree-tops were with mystery rife;<br />
And still, behind me&mdash;hieroglyph obscure<br />
Of antique alphabet&mdash;the lonely Faun<br />
Held to his laughter, through the falling night.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I went my way; but yet&mdash;in saddened spirit</span><br />
Pondering on all that had my vision crossed,<br />
Floating in air or scattered under foot,<br />
Confused and blent, beauty and spring and morn,<br />
Leaves of old summers, fair ones of old time&mdash;<br />
Through all, at distance would my fancy see,<br />
In the woods, statues; shadows in the past!<br />

<h2>CHARADES.</h2>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.</b>


<p>
Look from the prow of thine anchored bark&mdash;<br />
Anchored by classic shore&mdash;and mark,<br />
Down fathoms-deep in the purple sea,<br />
How Time and the waters have dealt on me<br />
<br />
Art lost in the moonless and starless night?<br />
Far-away looming, a light! a light!<br />
Fearlessly steer, for on me 'tis placed,<br />
To guide thy bark o'er the trackless waste<br />
<br />
Earth knows me, too; and will heave and quake<br />
Where my subterranean course I take:<br />
And none so aghast at my ravages then,<br />
As they whose type was the Sire of men.<br />
<br />
But not ever thus; at times I'm seen<br />
On the cheek or the neck of Beauty's queen;<br />
Or (to favoured mortal alone confest)<br />
Tinging the snow upon Beauty's breast.<br />
<br />
So, whether above the waves, or below,<br />
Or beneath the Earth, or on breast of snow,<br />
Linked with the past, or alive to-day,<br />
Tell who I am&mdash;if tell ye may.<br />
</p>


<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II.</b>


<p>
My lady calls; my First obeys&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor less his lord's behest:</span><br />
In bower and hall, in olden days,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My First was in request.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span><br />
Yet 'tis my First that tells us now<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What then my First was doing;</span><br />
How he went forth to war, and how<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He prospered in his wooing.</span><br />
<br />
A wise King bade the lazy fool<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Observe my Second's ways,</span><br />
And notice&mdash;as it were in school&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wisdom she displays.</span><br />
<br />
Yet hers is a devouring race,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And might&mdash;though strange it be&mdash;</span><br />
Eat up, in given time and place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My First, or you, or me.</span><br />
<br />
As for my whole&mdash;in every age<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mankind must have its show;</span><br />
In actual life, on mimic stage,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In peace, war, joy, or woe.</span><br />
<br />
Now 'tis a wedding, now a death,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A gathering, or a play;</span><br />
It comes, but, like a passing breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full soon 'tis swept away.</span><br />
</p>


<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III.</b>


<p>
When Richard of the Lion Heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In arms the Paynim sought,</span><br />
I of his panoply was part,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, wielding me, he fought.</span><br />
<br />
When ladies on a different field<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With men their skill essay,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>I am the weapon that they wield<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If they would gain the day.</span><br />
<br />
When cooks in certain dishes show<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their culinary art,</span><br />
I am on hand&mdash;the masters know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What flavour I impart.</span><br />
</p>


<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV.</b>


<p>
I'm a word of one syllable. Look you for me<br />
Mid Niagara's roar; in the turbulent sea;<br />
Where the winds and the waters are wildest at play,<br />
And fling off their laughter in volumes of spray.<br />
<br />
I'm a noun of five letters; but throw one aside&mdash;<br />
I'm a verb; with the noun I'm no longer allied.<br />
I'm a grave, solemn verb; nay, I truly might say,<br />
Those who follow my precept do nothing but pray.<br />
<br />
But again; let two letters be dropped&mdash;there's a change;<br />
As a noun&mdash;and by no means a grave one&mdash;I range.<br />
Now I'm here; now I'm there; seen by night and by day,<br />
For in short, I'm a beam, or a flash, or a ray.<br />
<br />
Thus a verb and two nouns packed together you see,<br />
In a word of one syllable.&mdash;What can it be?<br />
</p>


<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V.</b>


<p>
There are some words, that in a double sense<br />
Must be interpreted; of these am I.<br />
Your housemaid, thus, wilt know me literally<br />
Better than you do; but, with all respect<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>For Betty's carefulness, she scarce can catch<br />
My finer meaning. I'm, with her, a thing<br />
For brush and duster; in me, you behold<br />
A symbol. So much for me as I stand.<br />
Now cut my head off&mdash;I'm another word<br />
Of narrow and of wide significance,<br />
Handful of dust, the very world itself.<br />
Cut off my tail&mdash;the effect is still the same;<br />
I'm yet another of those duplex words:<br />
Mental and bodily, an essential part<br />
Of all mankind, without which no one lives,<br />
Nay, not an animal, though you may swear,<br />
And truly too, that I have no existence,<br />
And never had, in certain men and women.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Enough: it is not difficult to find</span><br />
Three words, six meanings, in one syllable.<br />
</p>


<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI.</b>


<p>
Well may I call myself cosmopolite,<br />
Being of all lands and times. Barbaric tribes<br />
Know me, and honour. In the gentler world,<br />
Scholars have studied me, and poets sung,<br />
And painters painted, and musicians hymned.<br />
Nor from Religion have I held myself<br />
Apart. In Pagan and in savage rites<br />
Largely I mingle; and some Saints at least,<br />
Worshipped among us, owe me much. In short,<br />
Theme, inspiration, puzzle&mdash;I am all.<br />
As to my form, it may not be defined;<br />
Yet this is certain: were I rent in twain<br />
And of one half bereft, I should not have<br />
A leg to stand on&mdash;of the other half<br />
Equally mulcted, I should endless be.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>


<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VII.</b>


<p>
In me, as the scholar saith,<br />
Is exhaustion, wasting, death.<br />
But&mdash;so close do grave and gay<br />
Touch, in this our world&mdash;you may,<br />
By a change of accent made,<br />
Change the meaning I conveyed;<br />
Change me so that I proclaim<br />
Victory won, and spoils, and fame!<br />
</p>


<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII.</b>


<p>
My first's a French noun; and, without it, stands not<br />
Church, palace, or hospital, villa, or cot.<br />
My Second no feature distinctive can claim;<br />
It but echoes my First&mdash;'t is precisely the same.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet my Whole to French parentage makes no pretence;</span><br />
It is plain Anglo-Saxon, in sound as in sense;<br />
Nor more widely asunder does pole lie from pole,<br />
Than my Gallican parts and my Anglican whole.<br />
Impalpable, it&mdash;solid, tangible, they;<br />
They may last, for long ages&mdash;it passes away!<br />
Now a sign of approval, a token of scorn;<br />
Sometimes of the wind or the waves it is born;<br />
Though its presence at intervals surely you'll trace<br />
Where my First and my Second have stablished their place;<br />
Where King hath his dwelling or Trade hath her marts&mdash;<br />
A whole evanescent, material parts!<br />

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

Gutenberg-tm License.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
